file-10,"After blowing up talks in a bizarre fit earlier this week, President Donald Trump has pulled a full 180 and is now desperate to reach a deal with Democrats on coronavirus relief.
Meanwhile, Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin is upping his offer to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.
Last week, before Trump walked out on the deal, it was $1.6 trillion.
Take the Deal, Pelosi
McConnell isn’t quite shutting the door on any possibility of a deal—because that would be rude—but he is coming awfully close, presumably because he’d rather spend his time confirming Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court and is not that invested in Donald Trump’s reelection strategy at this stage.
If McConnell wants to kill the package in the Senate because his life’s sole purpose is confirming conservative judges, then Democrats can spend the next three weeks flogging the GOP for that decision.

file-11,"While most people will view the fact that Trump paid almost nothing in income taxes over the past 15 years as a political matter—does this hurt or help him?
Taxpayers should be allowed to deduct economic losses they suffer if they have basis in the amounts lost.
You never paid tax on the $50 of gain when the price rose, so you can’t deduct the $50 loss when it falls back again.
A related issue is whether taxpayers should be allowed to deduct a loss in one year against gains from another year, whether in the past or going forward.
Much has been made of the fact that Trump paid little or nothing in taxes most years, often because he claimed massive losses incurred in previous years.
The next question is whether taxpayers should be allowed to use losses from one venture to offset gains in another, as Trump has done with his casino and other business losses to help him avoid paying taxes on his considerable earnings from The Apprentice.
However, if a business incurs this spending in pursuit of profit, the rules often allow such expenses to be deducted.
Trump could deduct his hair styling as a business expense, while you and I simply cannot.
Whether legitimate or illegitimate, the current rules afford opportunities for some taxpayers to run their personal expenses through their business to claim a deduction to which they are not necessarily entitled.
In Trump’s case, he deducted his hairstyling as a business expense, while you and I simply cannot.
He also allegedly claimed that the Seven Springs estate he owns in Westchester County, New York, was being held for investment—even though one of his sons once described it as a “family compound” where they spent lots of time—entitling Trump to significant deductions that are unavailable to others who own second homes.
While this last example does not involve running an expense through a business, it is yet another attempt to deduct personal consumption.
Next, the large consulting fees paid to Ivanka Trump raise interesting assignment of income questions.
By signing a deal with a land conservancy not to develop most of the land where the residence is located, Trump was able to claim a $21.1 million charitable tax deduction.
But after some initial plans for the property fell through, it’s not at all clear that Trump was still planning to develop the land or how much value was given up.
This works well for individuals, but not so well for businesses and the wealthy, whose income and expenses are often not reported by third parties to the IRS.","('tax', 0.4177917046369867)","('deduct', 0.26831886255477433)","('deduction', 0.20123914691608075)"
file-12,"Stop me if you’ve heard this one before: The next big thing in American soccer is a 17-year-old hybrid attacking force who’s earning major minutes alongside some of the world’s most exciting young players at perennial German powerhouse Borussia Dortmund.
Four (!) years after Christian Pulisic’s breakout season with Dortmund and the U.S. men’s national team, Gio Reyna is mirroring his countryman’s rapid rise with spooky precision.
Still, with Dortmund’s level of talent, all but the most optimistic forecasts envisioned another season as a rotation player, earning spot starts but mostly spelling the likes of Jadon Sancho, Marco Reus, Julian Brandt, and Thorgan Hazard off the bench.
Reyna to Haaland again!The 17-year-old American has three assists today!
His performance Saturday means Reyna is currently tied for the league lead in assists, and he’s either scored or assisted more than half of Dortmund’s seven goals in the still-young season.
Reyna is the son of U.S. men’s national team captain–turned–Major League Soccer executive Claudio Reyna.
Players with parents steeped in the game are likely to receive high-level instruction from a young age, even if it’s just in the park or the backyard, that their peers don’t get until they’re promoted to the right level with the right coach.
Present day Manchester City caused a triple-take on soccer Twitter in September when it started 17-year-old Liam Delap, the son of the industrious Irish midfielder Rory Delap, most famous for the chaos-instilling long throw-ins he’d catapult into the box with Stoke City and just about the last player you’d expect to get within even his throwing distance of a Pep Guardiola side.
In the U.S., you’re less likely to find an uncle who played in the third division or a neighbor who was in some big club’s youth ranks—someone who can be a coach or an opponent that identifies and polishes a young player’s promise and gives them the small, often informal boost they need to become a real prospect.
(You’re more likely, however, to have a woman in your life who played at a high level, like both Reyna and Pulisic’s mothers did.)
Dortmund’s attack is so stacked that, for head coach Lucien Favre, picking lineups is like choosing a proper loadout in a video game: more dribbling or more passing, ball progression or penetration, goal-scoring threat or defensive diligence?
Reyna’s ability to mold his game to fit his teammates will be crucial when he slots into the U.S. men’s national team’s attack, which seems likely to happen as soon as the U.S. is back to playing games with a full team.
One day it might not be necessary for an American player to be the son of soccer royalty to get a head start toward the top ranks of the sport.","('soccer', 0.43310772207935283)","('reyna', 0.2998438075933981)","('reyna’s', 0.2665278289719094)"
file-13,"The COVID pandemic and the work-from-home-in-sweatpants culture it’s accelerated tipped Brooks Brothers over a cliff.
For more than a century, Brooks Brothers defined fashion for a certain kind of East Coast American elite.
First, says fashion journalist Kate Betts, the Italians went after the top end: “In the ’80s, you had these Italian designers coming in and, at a slightly higher price point, offering a much different, more stylized look.” Brands like Giorgio Armani, she says, became the go-to for suits “for a certain aspirational customer.
Men were more open to fashion, and they no longer felt they needed to shop at one place and buy the same trusty make of clothes over and over.
“Brands like Ralph Lauren, Tommy Hilfiger, even J.Crew to a certain extent, came in and went for that Ivy League/English look that Brooks Brothers had really been the first to adapt to all the way back in 1818 at its founding,” Betts says.
“Ralph Lauren presented Brooks Brothers in a way that felt relevant to me as a person who’s not white.
… I speak to a lot of people in the menswear industry and even the tailoring trade who grew up as teens in the ’90s, and I find that’s a very common story: Many people first discovered classic clothing at a Ralph Lauren store.
Ralph Lauren had actually started in men’s fashion as a clerk at the Brooks Brothers flagship store in Manhattan.
In these new hands, some beloved Brooks Brothers items, like the classic Oxford cloth shirt, got some dubious updates.
Guy explains: “Historically, the Brooks Brothers collar was not lined, it was unlined.
… When the customer goes into Brooks Brothers, they may not know all this stuff about, whatever, single-needle stitching and all these kind of details.
Marks & Spencer sold Brooks Brothers in 2001 to Claudio Del Vecchio, son of the founder of Luxottica Group, the Italian eyewear conglomerate that owns brands like Ray-Ban and Oakley.
The sales guy who used to wear a suit for all his client calls was now maybe wearing a short-sleeved shirt and khakis.
The guy who used to wear khakis was now maybe wearing so-called athleisure clothing.
Casual and athleisure wear is just not what people expect or want from Brooks Brothers.
And then eventually the sweater gave way, and now many men only purchase a dress shirt and the chinos.
Of course, during a pandemic, when a work meeting means a Zoom call, men don’t need pants and shoes at all, never mind nice ones from Brooks.
Brooks had once been the uniform of the white-collar office worker.
“And I think Brooks Brothers represented a certain way of doing business that may just be very difficult to do in the future.”
“If it’s just a licensed name, it could be that 20 years down the road, Brooks Brothers lives on as a stack of shirts on Amazon,” he says.
Whether that suit will be made by Brooks Brothers remains to be seen.","('brooks', 0.7145778006598716)","('brothers', 0.3572889003299358)","('guy', 0.13629887940738925)"
file-14,"Aaron Sorkin, bard of blowhards, poet of patriotism, orchestrator of countless West Wing walk and talks and ripped-from-the-headlines clashes of ideas, is either the exact right or exact wrong writer for our highly unsubtle historical moment.
Sacha Baron Cohen brings energy and goofy verve to what might otherwise be (and sometimes is) a stodgy courtroom drama.
The Trial of the Chicago 7 (which begins streaming on Netflix on Friday) is only Sorkin’s second time around both writing and directing a feature film, and though he continues to be better at the former than the latter, the new movie is more ambitious and livelier than the sharply written but clunkily paced Molly’s Game.
This is in effect an all-star biopic, the story of not seven but eight ’60s counterculture figures who endured a protracted and highly publicized trial after the protests of the 1968 Democratic National Convention in Chicago turned violent.
Some, like Tom Hayden (Eddie Redmayne), were idealistic student organizers in the movement against the Vietnam War. Others, like Abbie Hoffman (Sacha Baron Cohen) and Jerry Rubin (Jeremy Strong), came from a more radical wing of the left, the pranksterish group Hoffman dubbed the Youth International Party, or the “Yippies.”

The range of approaches to protest among these groups—including the militant anti-racist Panthers, represented by Seale and his second-in-command Fred Hampton (Kelvin Harrison Jr.)—provides a springboard for any number of Sorkinian debates, some in the formal atmosphere of the courtroom, some in informal settings where the young activists butt heads.
Moreover, clips of the real-life Hoffman show that, big as Baron Cohen plays the character, the actor isn’t just hamming it up: The charismatic leader worked audiences at public events with the timing of a stand-up comic.
The film’s uninterrogated gender politics represent one of many ways in which The Trial of the Chicago 7, for all its firebrand banter, remains a fundamentally traditionalist movie.
But watching it at a moment when the majority of the population is moving leftward while our institutions are held hostage by a far-right minority—and when police violence continues, unchecked and unprosecuted, in the streets—provides the vicarious pleasure of watching a bunch of hyperarticulate progressives speak truth to power, and it feels pretty damn good, even if they do all talk a lot like Aaron Sorkin.

file-15,"29, Andrew Hitt, the chair of the Wisconsin state Republican Party, sent an open letter to Claire Woodall-Vogg, executive director of the Milwaukee Election Commission, to express his concern about the potential presence of sports mascots (including the Brewers’ racing sausages) at early voting centers.
That letter concerned the use of two sports venues—the Brewers’ Miller Park and the Bucks’ Fiserv Forum—as early voting sites.
Last week, the Milwaukee Election Commission announced that it was withdrawing the two sports facilities as early voting sites, citing the fear that they would be vulnerable to legal challenges, and that any votes cast there could be retroactively invalidated by a court.
Miller Park and Fiserv Forum were set to be just two among dozens of sports stadiums, arenas, and practice facilities that are, for the first time, going to become cogs in the democratic process.
Adapting these sites for voting is the result of a player-led movement that began with the Milwaukee Bucks and their wildcat strike in the NBA bubble after the shooting of Jacob Blake in Kenosha, Wisconsin.
Before play resumed in the NBA, the Players Association and the league agreed to a series of conditions; chief among them was the use of arenas as voting sites.
At a time when voter suppression continues to be an electoral strategy for one of the two major parties, and the coronavirus pandemic has made in-person voting riskier and more challenging, it seems like a good and intuitive idea to use stadiums as polling places.
A shortage in poll workers due to COVID fears led the city to go from 182 planned neighborhood polling places to just five on Election Day. The result was chaos, long lines, and exceptionally low turnout.
In a phone interview conducted before Fiserv Forum was canceled as a voting site, Milwaukee Bucks vice president Alex Lasry—whose father Marc co-owns the team—told Slate that he would like to see the arena used as a polling place not just in presidential and midterm elections, but in local races for years to come.
But as the Milwaukee case proves, the process of transforming sports venues into polling places is logistically and legally challenging in ways that go beyond even the demonization of mascots by Republicans bent on suppressing voter turnout in cities.
“You go to bed at night and the law is one way,” said Anita Johnson of Souls to the Polls, a Milwaukee organization committed to reaching voters through inner-city churches.
It’s the protest movement, after all, and the ensuing focus by LeBron James and other public figures on the vote, that led directly to the widespread use of sports venues as polling places.
This summer, when James announced the formation of More Than a Vote—an organization dedicated to protecting and turning out the Black vote—the biggest early headlines described the group’s successful push to use NBA facilities as voting sites.
As a high-profile initiative with the specific goal of getting out the vote, it’s tempting to think that the stadium polling sites would cause higher turnout and participation—but they may be more of an effect of the many other forces driving high voter engagement this cycle.
“I think it’s a combination of widespread national interest in racial justice and the pandemic happening simultaneously [driving engagement]—and the fact that these arenas aren’t actually being used for sports [that] makes them available,” said Barry Burden, a political science professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and founding director of its Elections Research Center.
Souls to the Polls has a stated goal of turning out 100,000 voters in Milwaukee.
The experts I spoke with—from Johnson in Milwaukee to elections experts like Burden and Kevin Morris of the Brennan Center for Justice, who wrote a report about Milwaukee’s disastrous April primary—said they believed that most voters would probably vote at the place most convenient for them, even if it’s not as glamorous as a pro sports facility.
“I don’t think [stadiums] are likely to turn out huge numbers of new voters who otherwise wouldn’t be voting somewhere else,” said Burden, even before Fiserv Forum and Miller Park were nixed as voting sites.
A world in which Fiserv Forum and Miller Park are even being considered as voting sites is a world that is already funneling more of the necessary resources to its electoral system.
But in Atlanta’s Fulton County, there were fewer problems—in part because State Farm Arena, home of the Hawks, was opened as an early voting site with free parking for voters.
In Milwaukee, election officials anticipate that more than half of ballots will be cast by absentee voters, either via mail, designated drop-off locations, or in-person early voting.
In essence, a world in which Fiserv Forum and Miller Park are even being considered as voting sites is a world that is already funneling more of the necessary resources to its electoral system.
After the debacle in April, Milwaukee appears to be on pace to have plenty of poll workers on Nov. 3, and to be ready to process the deluge of early ballots.
Likewise, LeBron James’ most important accomplishment this election may not be championing the stadiums, but the recent news that More Than a Vote has already recruited 10,000 poll workers, and that it has plans to recruit more in targeted cities throughout the country.
Last month, a federal judge issued a series of rulings that would have eased the burden on some voters: allowing poll workers to volunteer outside their counties of residence; allowing ballots postmarked on Election Day (Nov. 3) to be counted if they arrived by Nov. 9; extending the registration deadline from Oct. 14 to Oct. 21.
To a certain extent, it doesn’t matter that citizens, political activists, and major civic players like the Bucks want to expand voting access in Milwaukee.","('voting', 0.4613364731036919)","('milwaukee', 0.2606624340521073)","('polling', 0.21198986688660937)"
file-16,"On a humid, 90-degree day in early September, students at the University of Alabama in Tuscaloosa willed themselves to feel normal.
They were happy to be at college, and they didn’t grumble about the lack of on-campus events, or the online classes, or even the prospect of being placed in one of the dreary isolation dorms.
“There was a lot of sympathy from the older classes that our freshman year is this whole COVID situation,” a freshman named John told me.
And it may be strangest for students at large state schools like my alma mater, the University of Alabama, where football shapes the school’s identity.
To be a college student at Alabama this fall is to be, as the New York Times put it, a participant in a “high-stakes experiment.” UA is not the only large state school still holding classes in person, but it’s chosen to carry on when other schools would’ve put live instruction on pause.
The first week that the university publicly released its COVID numbers, 562 students had tested positive.
Students placed in COVID dorms told reporters that they weren’t given any information or care and received only sad, small meals.
Professors opened their emails one day to find a warning from the administration not to tell their students if one of their classmates had tested positive.
Parties are thought to be a major source of campus outbreaks, and the University of Alabama is the No. 1 party school in the nation.
College football is more popular here than anywhere else in America, and fans traveled from all over the state to Bryant-Denny Stadium for the first home game last weekend.
The fans in the stadium may have been thankful for whatever scraps of a game day they could get, but other students have been left wondering if it’s all worth it—if the massive effort to replicate the college experience was ever the right way to go.
On Aug. 18, the faculty senate asked the administration to identify the threshold at which the university would go fully online, and the school’s higher-ups responded by saying only that they were “monitoring multiple data points.” On Aug. 19, the first day of classes, the New York Times reported on an expensive, high-tech system that the University of Alabama System had developed to track cases and predict outbreaks.
Critics quickly pointed to the plan’s limitations: the long lag times, the high bar to be flagged by contact tracing, and the limited ability to regulate the behavior of students who lived off campus.
Early results supported the critics: After one week, there were 562 positive tests for students.
“The risk in closing a college campus and forcing thousands of students home at once is that the virus then has the opportunity to spread more widely to other geographic locations and possibly more vulnerable populations,” the university system said in a press release.
A public university has five main sources of money: state funding, tuition, investments, donations, and auxiliary services, which include merchandise, sports, and the expenses of living on campus.
Without in-person classes to keep students on campus, the university stood to lose a critical profit center.
A UCLA professor called Alabama “far and away the extreme” when it comes to recruiting out-of-state students, noting that the school received three times more in out-of-state tuition than in-state funding.
Football is such an essential part of the fabric of the university that when the school was looking for someone to run their COVID hotline and concierge service—providing meals and supplies for quarantining students—it turned to the events company that handles traffic and crowds on game days.
A freshman named Kalynn told me that while she decided to come to UA in large part because of football, she probably wouldn’t go to any games this year—students enter a lottery to get tickets, and even if she was one of the roughly 600 freshmen who got one, she wouldn’t be able to bring any friends along.
“If the university actually prioritized its students, we would make up more than 20 percent of the crowd at football games.”
If you ask out-of-state and sometimes even international students why they chose to attend the 65th-ranked public school in America, many will tell you it’s because it seemed like a quintessentially Southern experience, with football and Greek life and the partying that comes with it.
Alabama’s athletic department has not made its COVID policies fully public, but it has said it tests its players three times a week and screens them daily for symptoms.
“We’ve had a minimal amount of players that tested positive, but we have had some,” Alabama coach Nick Saban said early in September.
But they skirted the larger questions around amateurism, and whether it would be appropriate for colleges to continue playing football if other students weren’t on campus.
“Faculty are cynical about football, but they don’t understand how many students come to Alabama because they don’t know where they want to go to college, but they know it’s fun.”
This is what it looked like to be a rule-following freshman during the first few weeks at the University of Alabama.
Three weeks into the semester, the school reported sanctioning three student organizations and 639 students—suspending 33—for violating COVID guidelines.
A student who works for university housing told me that he never received any updates from the administration on COVID policies.
On Aug. 16, just before classes started, photos circulated on social media of bars packed for a Greek life event, prompting the university to close sorority and fraternity houses to all except those who lived there and those who had meal plans (to-go only) there.
Meredith, a senior who lives in a sorority house and who has a medical condition putting her at higher risk, said she felt the university wasn’t doing enough to keep COVID-positive students away from the rest of the student body.
Early in the semester, as the university tried frantically to control the narrative around the case numbers, the school president, Stuart Bell, sent a scolding email to the student body.
On Oct. 1, the university announced that there had been just 24 positive tests that week.
“The university has talked about how the plans are working,” Brooke, the Alabama junior, told me.
When I spoke with students in September, they said they hoped that the spring semester—in some cases, their last semester as college students—would be more normal.","('students', 0.4935770592152229)","('university', 0.26972531457336935)","('alabama', 0.2478499481268407)"
file-17,"Jack White, tapping on a guitar designed by Eddie Van Halen.
It’s rare these days for Saturday Night Live to book a musical guest with a taste for guitar heroics, but if there was ever a week to have someone strutting and windmilling around Studio 8H it was this one, which saw the death of guitar genius (and occasional inventor) Eddie Van Halen.
Jack White fit the bill admirably, turning in a blistering three-song medley and a performance of “Lazaretto” that included a nod to Van Halen’s trademark tapping style.
In his second song, White explicitly saluted Van Halen with his performance of “Lazaretto,” the title track from his 2014 album.
That has nothing to do with Jack White or Eddie Van Halen, but I think it’s neat.) Here’s the performance—at 2:42, White does a little Van Halen tapping:
That’s an Eddie Van Halen guitar (some custom version of the Wolfgang USA), featuring his patented guitar peghead, and as White explained on Instagram, using a guitar Van Halen designed seemed like a better tribute than “insult[ing] the man’s talent by trying to play one of his songs.”

file-18,"In his early career, Hertzfeldt brutalized his stick-figure protagonists as a dark joke, but over the past two decades, during which time he’s also become the most important independent animator in the United States, the horrors he’s visited upon them have become existential as well as physical.
Rejected, released in 2000, begins as deranged slapstick, with crudely drawn characters shrieking as blood gushes from their wounds, but by the end, the film itself starts to disintegrate, and it takes the viewer’s mind with it.
And in the World of Tomorrow series, whose third installment was self-released today, he explores the degradation of consciousness as it’s transferred from a woman named Emily to her several clones, some of whom function as little more than drooling backup units.

Where his early shorts feature line drawings floating in a sea of white, the World of Tomorrow series makes use of elaborate digital backdrops.
As I’ve watched Hertzfeldt’s movies over the years, I’ve always marveled at the depth of my response to these deceptively crude figures, who evoke visceral reaction in ways that more supple and realistic depictions do not.
World of Tomorrow Episode Three: The Absent Destinations of David Prime, shifts its perspective from Emily to David, the subject of her unrequited and then tragically realized love.
(Technically the consummation of their romance involves several generations of clones and a bit of time travel, but it’s too complicated to summarize here.) Four hundred years before the first episode begins, David is visited by one of Emily’s clones, who implants in his mind the directions to a planet where he can retrieve his future clone’s memories of the time when the two of them were happy together.
In a time when we’ve rightly questioned whether any fictional personage can exist outside of cultural specificity, Hertzfeldt’s stick figures may be the last truly universal characters.
As a longtime admirer of Hertzfeldt’s hand-drawn animation, I worried that the World of Tomorrow series’ switch to digital would rob his characters of their alchemical crudity, but if anything, the contrast between his minimalist figures and the intricately detailed world they inhabit has only grown starker, and more cruel.
It is called ‘Will You Be the One to Discover My Dead Body?’” But it also serves as camouflage for the hard-won sentimentality at the core of the World of Tomorrow films.

file-19,"When the NBA season started, the Miami Heat had 60-to-1 odds to win the championship, making them the 14th-most-likely team to win it all.
But after nearly a full calendar year of Sonic- and non-Sonic-related tumult, the long shots from South Beach are within striking distance of winning the NBA Finals.
FiveThirtyEight’s 2019-20 NBA forecast model, code-named RAPTOR, gives the Heat a 73 percent chance of winning the Finals.
How is it possible that the Lakers, a team with LeBron James and Anthony Davis, have just a 27 percent chance to win a seven-game series?
“Basically, the ‘predictive’ version of RAPTOR is wildly high on the Heat and down on the Lakers in the playoffs so far,” FiveThirtyEight’s Neil Paine told me.
RAPTOR takes that (among lots of other things) into account, and forecasts the Lakers won’t be as good as their past performances might lead you believe.
According to Paine, the gap between the Lakers’ standard and predictive RAPTOR scores is the fifth-widest that FiveThirtyEight has seen since 2014.
At that point, when Los Angeles was up two games to none against the Denver Nuggets in the Western Conference Finals, RAPTOR still gave LeBron and co.
just a 23 percent chance of winning the Finals.
Paine says that his “own personal intuition is that [RAPTOR] is underrating the Lakers.” But don’t underrate the scrappy Heat, either.
They’re both favorites and underdogs, just like those gritty Lakers.

file-20,"This article is excerpted from She Come by It Natural: Dolly Parton and the Women Who Lived Her Songs by Sarah Smarsh.
Excerpted with permission by Scribner, a Division of Simon & Schuster, Inc. The fourth of 12 siblings, Dolly Parton was born on a small farm in 1946; her father, Lee, paid the doctor a bag of grain for the delivery.
Of her many hits, Parton has described that tribute to her mother, Avie Lee, as the one most special to her.
She says she got her musical talent from that side of her family, whom she describes as “dreamers.” During Parton’s childhood, radios, record players, and electricity hadn’t yet reached the rural poor, and they entertained themselves in their own homes with old ways passed down from European country peasantry.
In one hit from her early career, “Applejack,” which she has said portrays a composite of real people, she tells of visiting a mountain-music man who gifted her his banjo when he died—a bit of Africa that had reached East Tennessee over the centuries.
While Parton’s musicianship and mentorship came from her mother’s family, her business acumen, she says, came from her father—a tenderhearted lifelong laborer who didn’t learn to read and write but nonetheless was savvy with a horse trade and could stretch a bit of money a long way.
That production stripped away the razzle-dazzle of backup bands and big sets featured on so many of her tours, putting Parton on a mostly bare stage with three backup musicians and a few cascades of white fabric.
At one point during the performance, Parton climbed a few steps to sit on a white platform described as a front porch but that turned out to be an elevated position for communing with heaven.
Before singing “Smoky Mountain Memories,” her 1978 song about poor workers drawn north during the midcentury factory boom, she paid tribute to her father’s hard work, economic decisions, and commitment to his family.
One imagines Parton, who told the crowd her family had running water “if we ran and got it,” absorbed her wit and natural poetry from her mother’s language.
“It wasn’t any of this, ‘please be my darling wife.’ Sheeeeit,” she said, and we both cracked up—not at our own family’s misfortunes but at the delusions of women who got a sentimental proposal and a big diamond before they spent a lifetime pushing a vacuum.
That darkness in a woman’s voice, plain stories of hell on Earth sung by women who have little to carry them forward but faith, is the divine feminine of American roots music.
“Little Sparrow,” from her 2001 album by the same name, blends the bluegrass, folk, and country gospel sounds of her native home and is sung in the voice of a jilted, devastated woman warning young girls to “never trust the hearts of men.” As haunting as the melody is, Parton—who is given to undercutting serious moments with an endearing bit of nervous humor—sets it up with a joke onstage: “I call it my little sad-ass song.”
Parton says you can’t be from where she’s from and not like woeful melodies.
But Parton insists that, in practice, her home was so rich in love that every material poverty was mitigated.
After the moving tribute to her musical mother and industrious father, at another stop on the same tour—in Austin, Texas—Parton made her way down the steps of the “porch” before it was wheeled offstage.
While the fast beat pulsed and one of her band members played another banjo, Parton tapped the air with her bow like a conductor.
Right before her solo, she pointed the bow at the cowboy and said in time with the rhythm, “You dance.” The sexy cowboy hooked his thumbs into the belt loops of his tight jeans and kicked up his heels in place while she fiddled, and the crowd roared.
Parton spends more time than the average performer onstage deferring to others with what, by all known accounts, is a sincere humility—praising the crowd, thanking her own band, honoring her family and her roots.
Sex was the third formative pillar of her life alongside music and religion, Parton said in her 1994 autobiography, My Life and Other Unfinished Business.
In that space of music, sex, and God, Parton wrote, she experienced a spiritual epiphany that “it was all right for me to be a sexual being.” Indeed, she has described herself as having been hormonally precocious both inside and out.
When her mother suggested she’d been possessed, Parton told her to give credit where it was due—not to Satan but to Dolly herself.
What women who didn’t grow up on a farm might miss is that, where Parton was from, this common act of female adolescent rebellion wasn’t just about attracting boys.
“[Glamorous women in magazines] didn’t look as if men and boys could just put their hands on them anytime they felt like it, and with any degree of roughness they chose.
My family’s poverty was nothing like Parton’s, but it was enough that I knew shame.
For women in poverty, though, it is not just a song but a way of life, not just a performance but a necessity.
As with Loretta Lynn, Tammy Wynette, Patsy Cline, and so many female country performers before and since, Parton’s music expresses this.

file-21,"But this year the league’s commitment to social justice got personal: Players started encouraging fans to vote against one of their team’s owners, Republican Sen. Kelly Loeffler, who, already vulnerable due to opposition within her party and allegations of insider trading, is fighting to hold a seat she was appointed to earlier this year.
To figure out why WNBA teams took this step and whether the player-led movement will shift Georgia and perhaps flip the Senate, I spoke with Amira Rose Davis, a critical sports scholar and assistant professor of history and African American studies at Penn State, for Tuesday’s episode of What Next.
Amira Rose Davis: Many rich people get involved with ownership of sports teams.
But then, when she and Mary Brock moved to purchase the team, that’s when she got a little bit more active, attending games, meeting with coaches.
Part of the reason why was that her association with the WNBA, which is seen as a very Black, LGBTQ league, was knocking her and her political aspirations in conservative circles.
One thing that illustrates this: A few years ago, the WNBA had a partnership with the Take a Seat, Take a Stand initiative that directed portions of game-day ticket sales to five partner organizations, one being Planned Parenthood.
Loeffler is focused on branding herself as a Trump conservative partially because of the kind of election she’s running right now.
In the special election to win her seat for real, Loeffler is competing against an especially large field of candidates, including firebrand conservative Rep. Doug Collins, because there was no primary in this race.
I think her escalation of drama with the WNBA is a naked aspiration to hold on to what little crumbling ground she has.
And after the anti–police brutality protests, the WNBA team that she partly owns comes out in favor of Black Lives Matter.
After the league in early July indicated that it was going to dedicate the season to Black Lives Matter, to #SayHerName, to Breonna Taylor, Loeffler wrote an open letter to the league’s president, Cathy Engelbert, and said she absolutely disagreed with this, that it was not a political movement the WNBA should be behind.
Right away, her own players were like, hey, I would love to have a conversation with you.
And Loeffler was like, well, I would welcome a conversation, but it would have to be a dialogue, you can’t cancel me.
At that point, a few players were like, your comments about mob rule are racially insensitive or racist.
We don’t think you should have an ownership stake in a team that’s predominately Black.
And at that point, only a few players were like, get out of here.
Loeffler was escalating it by doing the rounds on conservative media to position herself as victim of these liberal, LGBTQ, Black basketball players and a league behind them that is forcing her to celebrate and amplify Black Lives Matter.
Very quickly, WNBA players were like: This feels like political football.
Part of what I think makes what happened in the WNBA so interesting is that it wasn’t just the Dream that came forward and started speaking out about Loeffler—it was the league.
One of the ways that they decided to do that was to learn about Loeffler and her Senate race, whom she’s in competition with, the people running against her.
After meeting with Rev. Raphael Warnock [the Democratic candidate in the special election], a lot of the players on the Dream decided, we want shirts endorsing him.
But the collectivity of the teams played here: They all were like, we’re going to stand behind the Dream, we’re going to stand as a league, we’re going to stand very publicly rock these shirts, and we’re going to make sure you know who this candidate is because he is whom we believe in, not her.
I think she was very well positioned to have this scripted in a way like: Look at this big, bad, Black, LGBTQ league against little me.
What’s at stake for the WNBA players?
WNBA teams have always engaged in risk.
When we talk about stakes, it’s really important to know this WNBA season was important even before the pandemic, because it was the first season being played under the new collective bargaining agreement they’d fought for.","('loeffler', 0.35932796375467546)","('her', 0.2106614950457155)","('conservative', 0.15327404252353996)"

Had Morris found him on the opposite wing, he would’ve had more than just an open shot.
He would’ve had a chance to make a Finals-winning jumper, one that would usurp the 2016 chase-down block on Andre Iguodala as the play that defines his legacy.
For that to happen, Morris would’ve had to get him the ball on time and on target.

It looks like Morris winging a pass into Lake Apopka.

Butler explained to reporters after the game that the bon mot did not materialize out of thin air: James had said the same thing to him at the end of the first quarter, and Butler was simply returning the volley, with interest.
He is the first player to score 40 points in a Finals game without attempting a single 3-pointer since Shaquille O’Neal did it in 2002.
According to @EliasSports Jimmy Butler scored or assisted on 73 points, tied for the 2nd-most in an NBA Finals game in league history.
(Walt Frazier, 74)Butler is the first player with a 40-point Finals game without attempting a three since Shaquille O'Neal in 2002.
Had you been scoring it like a boxing match, the Heat star would have come out the clear winner, but Butler won in accordance with normal basketball scoring, too, so let’s just stick with that.
Jimmy Butler is the first player to outscore, outrebound and out-assist LeBron James in a Finals game, including LeBron's teammates.
His game developed slowly and steadily over three seasons in Wisconsin and, come his senior year, Butler was good enough to be a first-round pick (albeit the very last pick of the first round).
Butler barely played during his rookie season with the Chicago Bulls, but he made a string of impressive appearances in his second year while filling in for injured forward Luol Deng.
In one of those games, a win against the Lakers, Butler held Kobe Bryant to just 16 points.
After leading the Philadelphia 76ers to a Game 2 victory over the Toronto Raptors last year, Philly head coach Brett Brown said, “This was James Butler.
That was the adult in the gym.” When a reporter relayed that quote to Butler, he said, “My name isn’t James.
Charles Barkley on NBA TV: ""I have a question...you clearly have not made it to the barber in the bubble.""Jimmy Butler: ""That's not a question.""— Jared Weiss (@JaredWeissNBA) October 5, 2020

file-25,"On Wednesday, the Big Ten conference announced that, after delaying its fall sports season on account of the coronavirus, it will, in fact, try to play football this semester—and the Pac-12, its fellow major holdout, is expected to soon announce the same, albeit on a slower schedule.
Egregiously well-paid Big Ten coaches have been vocally upset about not getting to put their unpaid players on the field; Donald Trump and various right-wing “shut up and play” figures in the sports world have said, among many other bad and insane things, that dying while playing college football this year would be an act commensurate with dying so that the Allies could retake Normandy.
• All players, coaches, and support staffers must receive a negative result on a rapid COVID test before participating in a practice or game.
(A report from earlier in the month claimed that Trump had offered the conference access to rapid tests that the federal government has ordered; an anonymous Big Ten president, however, told NBC Wednesday that Trump “had nothing to do with our decision.” The federal government’s contract is with Abbott Laboratories, and while the Big Ten’s announcement does not name its test provider, previous reports have cited a different company, Quidel Corporation, as a potential college football source.)
In theory, these protocols should eliminate the incentive and opportunity for an entire team to get COVID during training camp, which is what Louisiana State coach Ed Orgeron said Tuesday has happened to his squad, which is the defending national champion.
If you were to play college football right now, the system the Big Ten claims it’s putting in place is how you would do it while respecting the stated interests and health of the players involved.
The resources that major college football teams have access to, meanwhile, are dependent on those teams continuing to play games on TV; there aren’t tens of millions of dollars sitting in the bank right now that teams could be donating to essential workers and at-risk populations if they weren’t returning to the field.
But it’s at least possible to envision the plan working out OK; not every team that’s playing now has gone full LSU, and the Big Ten will be starting with more cautious parameters.
The conference’s announcement, in sum, could potentially (potentially!) improve the lives of college football players and fans this fall, which, in these times, is not nothing.
The enemy is the people who are ready to call it a day because they found a way to send Jim Harbaugh back to work; the job of building (rebuilding?) a society whose non-sports aspects are also functional remains important and incomplete, but achievable.","('ten', 0.5372573524357722)","('football', 0.17687303491202847)","('rapid', 0.15024126922328648)"
file-26,"29, Andrew Hitt, the chair of the Wisconsin state Republican Party, sent an open letter to Claire Woodall-Vogg, executive director of the Milwaukee Election Commission, to express his concern about the potential presence of sports mascots (including the Brewers’ racing sausages) at early voting centers.
That letter concerned the use of two sports venues—the Brewers’ Miller Park and the Bucks’ Fiserv Forum—as early voting sites.
Last week, the Milwaukee Election Commission announced that it was withdrawing the two sports facilities as early voting sites, citing the fear that they would be vulnerable to legal challenges, and that any votes cast there could be retroactively invalidated by a court.
Miller Park and Fiserv Forum were set to be just two among dozens of sports stadiums, arenas, and practice facilities that are, for the first time, going to become cogs in the democratic process.
Adapting these sites for voting is the result of a player-led movement that began with the Milwaukee Bucks and their wildcat strike in the NBA bubble after the shooting of Jacob Blake in Kenosha, Wisconsin.
Before play resumed in the NBA, the Players Association and the league agreed to a series of conditions; chief among them was the use of arenas as voting sites.
At a time when voter suppression continues to be an electoral strategy for one of the two major parties, and the coronavirus pandemic has made in-person voting riskier and more challenging, it seems like a good and intuitive idea to use stadiums as polling places.
A shortage in poll workers due to COVID fears led the city to go from 182 planned neighborhood polling places to just five on Election Day. The result was chaos, long lines, and exceptionally low turnout.
In a phone interview conducted before Fiserv Forum was canceled as a voting site, Milwaukee Bucks vice president Alex Lasry—whose father Marc co-owns the team—told Slate that he would like to see the arena used as a polling place not just in presidential and midterm elections, but in local races for years to come.
But as the Milwaukee case proves, the process of transforming sports venues into polling places is logistically and legally challenging in ways that go beyond even the demonization of mascots by Republicans bent on suppressing voter turnout in cities.
“You go to bed at night and the law is one way,” said Anita Johnson of Souls to the Polls, a Milwaukee organization committed to reaching voters through inner-city churches.
It’s the protest movement, after all, and the ensuing focus by LeBron James and other public figures on the vote, that led directly to the widespread use of sports venues as polling places.
This summer, when James announced the formation of More Than a Vote—an organization dedicated to protecting and turning out the Black vote—the biggest early headlines described the group’s successful push to use NBA facilities as voting sites.
As a high-profile initiative with the specific goal of getting out the vote, it’s tempting to think that the stadium polling sites would cause higher turnout and participation—but they may be more of an effect of the many other forces driving high voter engagement this cycle.
“I think it’s a combination of widespread national interest in racial justice and the pandemic happening simultaneously [driving engagement]—and the fact that these arenas aren’t actually being used for sports [that] makes them available,” said Barry Burden, a political science professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and founding director of its Elections Research Center.
Souls to the Polls has a stated goal of turning out 100,000 voters in Milwaukee.
The experts I spoke with—from Johnson in Milwaukee to elections experts like Burden and Kevin Morris of the Brennan Center for Justice, who wrote a report about Milwaukee’s disastrous April primary—said they believed that most voters would probably vote at the place most convenient for them, even if it’s not as glamorous as a pro sports facility.
“I don’t think [stadiums] are likely to turn out huge numbers of new voters who otherwise wouldn’t be voting somewhere else,” said Burden, even before Fiserv Forum and Miller Park were nixed as voting sites.
A world in which Fiserv Forum and Miller Park are even being considered as voting sites is a world that is already funneling more of the necessary resources to its electoral system.
But in Atlanta’s Fulton County, there were fewer problems—in part because State Farm Arena, home of the Hawks, was opened as an early voting site with free parking for voters.
In Milwaukee, election officials anticipate that more than half of ballots will be cast by absentee voters, either via mail, designated drop-off locations, or in-person early voting.
In essence, a world in which Fiserv Forum and Miller Park are even being considered as voting sites is a world that is already funneling more of the necessary resources to its electoral system.
After the debacle in April, Milwaukee appears to be on pace to have plenty of poll workers on Nov. 3, and to be ready to process the deluge of early ballots.
Likewise, LeBron James’ most important accomplishment this election may not be championing the stadiums, but the recent news that More Than a Vote has already recruited 10,000 poll workers, and that it has plans to recruit more in targeted cities throughout the country.
Last month, a federal judge issued a series of rulings that would have eased the burden on some voters: allowing poll workers to volunteer outside their counties of residence; allowing ballots postmarked on Election Day (Nov. 3) to be counted if they arrived by Nov. 9; extending the registration deadline from Oct. 14 to Oct. 21.
To a certain extent, it doesn’t matter that citizens, political activists, and major civic players like the Bucks want to expand voting access in Milwaukee.","('voting', 0.4613364731036919)","('milwaukee', 0.2606624340521073)","('polling', 0.21198986688660937)"

They booked their ticket to the Finals on Sunday by beating the Boston Celtics, 125-113, and the ease with which the No. 5 seed in the Eastern Conference closed out the fourth quarter belied just how unlikely their whole postseason run has been.
That’s how the Heat did it 10 years ago, when they brought in LeBron James and Chris Bosh to team up with Dwyane Wade.
And that’s how Miami’s opponent in the NBA Finals, the Los Angeles Lakers, have done it.
Butler joined a young, developing big man in Bam Adebayo, veteran Goran Dragic, and young guards Tyler Herro (a rookie), Kendrick Nunn (an undrafted rookie), and Duncan Robinson (who went undrafted out of Michigan after starting his college career in Division III).

file-29,"So I am as surprised as anyone that the true joy of my past two weeks—maybe the true joy of this whole cursed year—has been watching a sporting event, the Tour de France.
Remember the roll call at the Democratic National Convention, where they did a whirlwind tour of the country and it felt a little like all that traveling you can’t do right now?
The Tour is like that, except for days and days, and in France, a country you currently cannot visit.
People have been living in France for a long time—a très long time, from the looks of it!—and most of that time, they have been building chateaux and literal castles and many, many churches.
And in the Tour, they bike through it all, and you get to watch, from the living room you do not leave.
One wonderful, hilarious thing about the Tour de France is that the announcers have a lot of time to fill, since, after all, the athletes are just biking for kilometers and kilometers.
When it comes to the historical stuff, Bob seems to have some sort of packet that was compiled by the French bureau of tourism, so every time we are staring at some sort of landmark, Phil will casually say, “Bob, do you know anything about this église?” And then Bob will take it away, clearly reading from his dossier of notable Tour scenery.
I’m not saying everything is normal: There are way fewer people watching the Tour from the sidelines compared with other years, and they are all wearing masks.
But they are there, and they are cheering, and I cannot deny that I have cried multiple times just watching it and remembering the joy that can occur when people are in the same space together, interacting.
As much as I don’t normally get sports, I am not watching the Tour for all those charming cowbells; I am here for drama.
Riding the Tour de France is one of the most ambitious athletic endeavors anyone can attempt.
Except it’s more exciting than watching people run a marathon, because there is way more to watch for than who wins.
You get to fall in love with many riders, for different reasons, and root for a bunch of people for all kinds of stuff.
The real reason I became addicted to the Tour de France this year has to do with one specific rider, Julian Alaphilippe, a French cyclist and beautiful man with a great name.
He wore the yellow jersey for 14 stages last Tour, and the French people love him.
An announcer recently referred to the way he rides his bike as being “frisky”—when was the last time any aspect of life in a pandemic could be frisky?

Mobility is the most obvious thing that separates Brady and Newton, even after the latter spent most of last season recovering from a Lisfranc injury (which is a hurt foot—I had to Google it).
The Patriots’ new quarterback ran the ball 15 times for 75 yards and two touchdowns on Sunday.
For reference, that’s more than twice as many rushing yards than Brady had all last season (34).

Tom Brady had the same coach for 19 straight seasons.
Bruce Arians may have amended his blame on Tom Brady for one of those INTs but still didn't like what he saw from 12.

For 19 straight summers, Tom Brady sat down and wrote “Buffalo Bills,” “New York Jets,” and “Miami Dolphins” on his calendar.
On Sunday, however, he had to play the New Orleans Saints.
The games should get easier for the Bucs, but the opener was a gentle reminder that not everyone gets to play the Jets twice.
Hell, they beat Tom Brady and the Patriots in Week 17 last year and cost New England a bye.
For nearly two decades the image of him wearing a Patriots jersey had seared itself into the brain of every football fan, so any new uniform he decides to put on is bound to look weird.","('brady', 0.547014996753635)","('tom', 0.1931202931595214)","('september', 0.1315210842866552)"
file-32,"There has been some excellent basketball, starting with the “seeding games” contested by the 22 teams invited to the bubble and continuing into the conference finals, as only the Boston Celtics, Miami Heat, Denver Nuggets, and Los Angeles Lakers remain.
Potential disease vectors that we are, fans have not been allowed inside the bubble, though we can follow the action on TNT, ESPN, and ABC.
It’s not every season that the league’s television partners have to produce high-level live coverage during a pandemic and from a theme park, but they’ve made it work.
Brown spent about three weeks inside the bubble helping TNT’s crews get set up and has been overseeing their productions throughout the NBA’s restart.
In our conversation, we talked about fancy new cameras, rampant on-court swearing, and why we don’t see the players’ families on TV.
From a production and content standpoint, we’ve made some adjustments in terms of adding a couple more of our super-slow-motion cameras, Hypermotion cameras, things like that.
We’ve been able to experiment with our rail-cam, and it’s been well received.
We’ve also been able to go back to putting a handheld on the camera side at center court.
These are things that, in our traditional coverage, we have not been able to do, either because of fans or because of safety.
We’ve been able to take a mix of that and, with the help of the NBA and some of their vendors, we take that collective knowledge and the collective library of crowd noises and what we call “swells” and leverage them into a tool that the NBA is using courtside.
There are a number of audio feeds going between this particular group and our production facilities so that we can integrate it into the broadcast mix.
To me, it’s seemed as if the crowd noise has improved over time.
You’ve got an opportunity where these audio mixers are able to listen to their colleagues’ mixes.
No one has ever broadcasted NBA playoff games from a bubble before, so there had to have been lots of unpredictable elements.
One of the things that we’ve been excited about, that the NBA has been excited about, has been the access to microphones and being able to hear a little bit more of the conversations that happen on the court.
When we implement our traditional standards and practices, you have a person who’s listening for profanity or whatever it may be, and they may hear one or two things throughout the telecast.
It took a little bit of work because we’re utilizing a couple of different audio control rooms in order to make this happen.
We’ve been fortunate in that, in the beginning of the ’19–’20 season, we embarked on a project where we superimposed the shot clock on the court.
Because we are in nontraditional venues, the NBA’s events team had a particularly strenuous time trying to get these venues lit in such a way that we could produce these graphics.
We were able to get that messaging back to the teams to ask them to not wear those uniforms anymore.
I’ve not gotten direct feedback, but I think the main thing is that they could be present and actually at the games—to be on site, be safe, but also to be able to feel the energy of the room, to be watching with their own eyes, looking to the corner to see the coaches, looking at the clock, seeing which players are looking at the clock.
Number two was, how do we manage this given the way the NBA split up the zones where people are able to go [inside the venues]?
One of the requirements for us was that we wanted to make sure the announcers weren’t calling the game wearing a mask.
The NBA has allowed players’ families to come to games, but I’ve noticed there haven’t been many shots of them in the crowd.
Are there any production strategies you’ve had to implement in Orlando that might make it out of the bubble for normal broadcasts, whenever those resume?
With what we’re looking at, from a cameras and coverage standpoint, those are some things that we’d love to keep, but they’re going to require the NBA to sign off on them.
They’re going to require the players to sign off on them.","('audio', 0.22745209565284485)","('we’ve', 0.17408538667957835)","('announcers', 0.15690490281210542)"
file-33,"The Miami Heat have played better games.
Their swaggering journey through the 2020 postseason hit its first real moment of doubt on Wednesday night, as they opened the NBA Finals with a 116–98 loss to the Los Angeles Lakers.
Then, in a moment of perverse cruelty, the NBA made them play the remaining quarter and a half.
Kelly Olynyk wound up playing 18 minutes.
(He returned to action, though slightly hobbled.) Goran Dragic, who’s been playing like a Slovenian Steve Nash in these playoffs, missed the second half with a foot injury that is apparently quite severe.
Miami's Goran Dragic has suffered a plantar tear of left foot, source tells ESPN.— Adrian Wojnarowski (@wojespn) October 1, 2020
But we can do the next best thing, which is to consider all the ways Game 1 could have gone worse for Miami.
As the cliché goes, it’s a seven-game series, and this only counts as one loss for Miami.
It would be much, much worse, obviously, if it was a three-game series and each loss counted twice.
Herro’s magic touch eluded him on Wednesday, as his plus-minus in the first half was a staggering minus-30 in 18 minutes of action.
But Miami will always have those first seven minutes.
Going forward, if they beat the Lakers by 13 points in each seven-minute segment of action, they’ll win each game by an average of 89 points.

file-34,"29, Andrew Hitt, the chair of the Wisconsin state Republican Party, sent an open letter to Claire Woodall-Vogg, executive director of the Milwaukee Election Commission, to express his concern about the potential presence of sports mascots (including the Brewers’ racing sausages) at early voting centers.
That letter concerned the use of two sports venues—the Brewers’ Miller Park and the Bucks’ Fiserv Forum—as early voting sites.
Last week, the Milwaukee Election Commission announced that it was withdrawing the two sports facilities as early voting sites, citing the fear that they would be vulnerable to legal challenges, and that any votes cast there could be retroactively invalidated by a court.
Miller Park and Fiserv Forum were set to be just two among dozens of sports stadiums, arenas, and practice facilities that are, for the first time, going to become cogs in the democratic process.
Adapting these sites for voting is the result of a player-led movement that began with the Milwaukee Bucks and their wildcat strike in the NBA bubble after the shooting of Jacob Blake in Kenosha, Wisconsin.
Before play resumed in the NBA, the Players Association and the league agreed to a series of conditions; chief among them was the use of arenas as voting sites.
At a time when voter suppression continues to be an electoral strategy for one of the two major parties, and the coronavirus pandemic has made in-person voting riskier and more challenging, it seems like a good and intuitive idea to use stadiums as polling places.
A shortage in poll workers due to COVID fears led the city to go from 182 planned neighborhood polling places to just five on Election Day. The result was chaos, long lines, and exceptionally low turnout.
In a phone interview conducted before Fiserv Forum was canceled as a voting site, Milwaukee Bucks vice president Alex Lasry—whose father Marc co-owns the team—told Slate that he would like to see the arena used as a polling place not just in presidential and midterm elections, but in local races for years to come.
But as the Milwaukee case proves, the process of transforming sports venues into polling places is logistically and legally challenging in ways that go beyond even the demonization of mascots by Republicans bent on suppressing voter turnout in cities.
“You go to bed at night and the law is one way,” said Anita Johnson of Souls to the Polls, a Milwaukee organization committed to reaching voters through inner-city churches.
It’s the protest movement, after all, and the ensuing focus by LeBron James and other public figures on the vote, that led directly to the widespread use of sports venues as polling places.
This summer, when James announced the formation of More Than a Vote—an organization dedicated to protecting and turning out the Black vote—the biggest early headlines described the group’s successful push to use NBA facilities as voting sites.
As a high-profile initiative with the specific goal of getting out the vote, it’s tempting to think that the stadium polling sites would cause higher turnout and participation—but they may be more of an effect of the many other forces driving high voter engagement this cycle.
“I think it’s a combination of widespread national interest in racial justice and the pandemic happening simultaneously [driving engagement]—and the fact that these arenas aren’t actually being used for sports [that] makes them available,” said Barry Burden, a political science professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and founding director of its Elections Research Center.
Souls to the Polls has a stated goal of turning out 100,000 voters in Milwaukee.
The experts I spoke with—from Johnson in Milwaukee to elections experts like Burden and Kevin Morris of the Brennan Center for Justice, who wrote a report about Milwaukee’s disastrous April primary—said they believed that most voters would probably vote at the place most convenient for them, even if it’s not as glamorous as a pro sports facility.
“I don’t think [stadiums] are likely to turn out huge numbers of new voters who otherwise wouldn’t be voting somewhere else,” said Burden, even before Fiserv Forum and Miller Park were nixed as voting sites.
A world in which Fiserv Forum and Miller Park are even being considered as voting sites is a world that is already funneling more of the necessary resources to its electoral system.
But in Atlanta’s Fulton County, there were fewer problems—in part because State Farm Arena, home of the Hawks, was opened as an early voting site with free parking for voters.
In Milwaukee, election officials anticipate that more than half of ballots will be cast by absentee voters, either via mail, designated drop-off locations, or in-person early voting.
In essence, a world in which Fiserv Forum and Miller Park are even being considered as voting sites is a world that is already funneling more of the necessary resources to its electoral system.
After the debacle in April, Milwaukee appears to be on pace to have plenty of poll workers on Nov. 3, and to be ready to process the deluge of early ballots.
Likewise, LeBron James’ most important accomplishment this election may not be championing the stadiums, but the recent news that More Than a Vote has already recruited 10,000 poll workers, and that it has plans to recruit more in targeted cities throughout the country.
Last month, a federal judge issued a series of rulings that would have eased the burden on some voters: allowing poll workers to volunteer outside their counties of residence; allowing ballots postmarked on Election Day (Nov. 3) to be counted if they arrived by Nov. 9; extending the registration deadline from Oct. 14 to Oct. 21.
To a certain extent, it doesn’t matter that citizens, political activists, and major civic players like the Bucks want to expand voting access in Milwaukee.","('voting', 0.4613364731036919)","('milwaukee', 0.2606624340521073)","('polling', 0.21198986688660937)"
file-35,"I used to be excited when it was to time to announce the Pantone Color of the Year.
But what Pantone’s press-generating new colors invariably do is serve Pantone’s business interests—while further diluting a brand that’s looked faded for a very long time.
Though many people know Pantone has something to do with color, the average person would probably have difficulty pinpointing what exactly it is that the company does.
On the surface, this system seems like a useful service, but ultimately it’s become a way to try to make color a private business.
Trump Wants a Stimulus Deal Again.
In 2000, Pantone began designating its Color of the Year, with the “Pantone Color Institute” using the dubious art of trend forecasting to choose a color that captures the cultural vanguard.
In its announcement of Ultra Violet as the Color of 2018, Pantone invoked Prince, David Bowie, and Jimi Hendrix, who, Pantone said, used shades of Ultra Violet “as personal expressions of individuality.” Though it’s true that purple may have played some part in these musicians’ aesthetics, it felt like a land grab to annex these musicians’ choices into a single, proprietary hue.
Pantone fashions itself an omniscient oracle for trends, but there is little evidence of it pushing culture forward; instead it resells the same product in new colors, each named after a piece of IP or a Twitter trending topic from three years ago.
Pantone long ago became a kind of shorthand for the design-conscious individual to flaunt their knowledge in the same way people use Moleskines or Blackwing pencils.* At the same time, through aggressive growth and trademarking, Pantone has burrowed itself so deeply into our economy that everything from the packages our fries come in to the knickknacks you find at museums generates money for the company.
Somehow, it has maintained a reputation as a design-world institution and a diviner of trends, when what it’s really selling is an outmoded system—at a time when colors can be described in code—decorated with a lot of meaningless ornament.","('pantone', 0.40540187418876783)","('color', 0.29271897005128017)","('colors', 0.24353671244310007)"

Much to the dismay of civil rights groups, demographers, Democrats, and really anybody with an interest in political fairness or statistical rigor, the Trump administration is now set to bring this year’s all-important Census count to an early end.
Thanks to a friendly ruling from the Supreme Court on Tuesday, the Commerce Department will wrap up its tallying process on Oct. 15, two weeks ahead of schedule, as it rushes to get data to Donald Trump so he’ll have time to control the process of deciding how many members of Congress each state will have for the next decade.
Experts have warned that this move will likely lead to a less accurate Census by cutting short the time to track down Americans who are generally harder to reach, such as immigrants and low-income minorities.
This week, the government reported that 99.9 percent of households in the country had already been “enumerated,” to use the Census Bureau’s technical term.
“The 99.9 percent completion rates is a smokescreen and it is misleading,” says Terri Ann Lowenthal, a Census expert and consultant for the Leadership Conference Education Fund, which has spearheaded this year’s Census Counts advocacy campaign to ensure the count is accurate and fair.
When the Census Bureau says that 99.9 percent of all American households have been “enumerated,” what it means is that the government believes it has counted the number of people living at nearly all of the residential addresses contained in its master list.
The potentially bigger issue, however, is that many households may just have been counted incorrectly—and marginalized groups are especially likely to have been undercounted in the rush to get the Census done.
This is also the first year that the Census Bureau has tried to use administrative data, such as tax, Medicare, and Social Security records, to try and count some households that did not fill out their own responses.
In short, assuring us that 99.9 percent of households have been counted in order to end the Census early doesn’t really tell us much of anything about whether the data is any good.
But a small amount of extra time could have made important differences at the margins, allowing Census takers to knock on more doors, especially in undercounted areas like Shreveport, and giving more households the chance to send in their own Census forms at the last minute.
“A very large number of households have been counted in ways that guarantee errors and inequalities and less quality data that we could have in two or three weeks,” former Census Bureau Director Kenneth Prewitt told me.","('census', 0.3055811696326896)","('households', 0.2654677354159228)","('bureau', 0.1786659791231985)"

It’s never been difficult to picture Davis dominating the NBA Finals.
Nearly every team in the association could be considered one Anthony Davis short of competing for a championship.
He wanted to join the league’s most successful franchise of the past 20 years: whomever LeBron James happened to be playing for.
After eight consecutive finals appearances, LeBron didn’t even make the playoffs in his first season with the Lakers.
Even LeBron’s longtime running mate has been forced to concede that Davis is the best sidekick James has ever had.
But is “LeBron’s best deputy” an appropriate designation for a unicorn like Davis, one who hit the decisive shot in Game 4 and changed the series by locking down Miami’s Jimmy Butler on the defensive end?
Maybe Davis is best seen as the LeBron here—the superstar who uproots himself and switches teams to pursue a title.
In New Orleans, he made more appearances on the All-NBA first team (three) than the playoffs (two), so it makes sense that he’d want to transplant himself onto a title contender and round out his résumé.
But by choosing the Lakers, he pretty much conceded that his achievements would be viewed in the context of LeBron James’ career, not unlike how Kevin Durant’s move to the Warriors has been seen by many (most?
Is it weird to want more for Anthony Davis?
If Anthony Davis thought being called “LeBron’s best teammate” was an insult, he probably wouldn’t have forced his way to Los Angeles in the first place.
Still, Davis remains deferential to LeBron.
Maybe that’s why I keep coming back to that courtside video of Davis nailing a dagger 3 in Game 4.
In this moment, Davis was the star and LeBron was the hype man.

file-39,"On a humid, 90-degree day in early September, students at the University of Alabama in Tuscaloosa willed themselves to feel normal.
They were happy to be at college, and they didn’t grumble about the lack of on-campus events, or the online classes, or even the prospect of being placed in one of the dreary isolation dorms.
“There was a lot of sympathy from the older classes that our freshman year is this whole COVID situation,” a freshman named John told me.
And it may be strangest for students at large state schools like my alma mater, the University of Alabama, where football shapes the school’s identity.
To be a college student at Alabama this fall is to be, as the New York Times put it, a participant in a “high-stakes experiment.” UA is not the only large state school still holding classes in person, but it’s chosen to carry on when other schools would’ve put live instruction on pause.
The first week that the university publicly released its COVID numbers, 562 students had tested positive.
Students placed in COVID dorms told reporters that they weren’t given any information or care and received only sad, small meals.
Professors opened their emails one day to find a warning from the administration not to tell their students if one of their classmates had tested positive.
Parties are thought to be a major source of campus outbreaks, and the University of Alabama is the No. 1 party school in the nation.
College football is more popular here than anywhere else in America, and fans traveled from all over the state to Bryant-Denny Stadium for the first home game last weekend.
The fans in the stadium may have been thankful for whatever scraps of a game day they could get, but other students have been left wondering if it’s all worth it—if the massive effort to replicate the college experience was ever the right way to go.
On Aug. 18, the faculty senate asked the administration to identify the threshold at which the university would go fully online, and the school’s higher-ups responded by saying only that they were “monitoring multiple data points.” On Aug. 19, the first day of classes, the New York Times reported on an expensive, high-tech system that the University of Alabama System had developed to track cases and predict outbreaks.
Critics quickly pointed to the plan’s limitations: the long lag times, the high bar to be flagged by contact tracing, and the limited ability to regulate the behavior of students who lived off campus.
Early results supported the critics: After one week, there were 562 positive tests for students.
“The risk in closing a college campus and forcing thousands of students home at once is that the virus then has the opportunity to spread more widely to other geographic locations and possibly more vulnerable populations,” the university system said in a press release.
A public university has five main sources of money: state funding, tuition, investments, donations, and auxiliary services, which include merchandise, sports, and the expenses of living on campus.
Without in-person classes to keep students on campus, the university stood to lose a critical profit center.
A UCLA professor called Alabama “far and away the extreme” when it comes to recruiting out-of-state students, noting that the school received three times more in out-of-state tuition than in-state funding.
Football is such an essential part of the fabric of the university that when the school was looking for someone to run their COVID hotline and concierge service—providing meals and supplies for quarantining students—it turned to the events company that handles traffic and crowds on game days.
A freshman named Kalynn told me that while she decided to come to UA in large part because of football, she probably wouldn’t go to any games this year—students enter a lottery to get tickets, and even if she was one of the roughly 600 freshmen who got one, she wouldn’t be able to bring any friends along.
“If the university actually prioritized its students, we would make up more than 20 percent of the crowd at football games.”
If you ask out-of-state and sometimes even international students why they chose to attend the 65th-ranked public school in America, many will tell you it’s because it seemed like a quintessentially Southern experience, with football and Greek life and the partying that comes with it.
Alabama’s athletic department has not made its COVID policies fully public, but it has said it tests its players three times a week and screens them daily for symptoms.
“We’ve had a minimal amount of players that tested positive, but we have had some,” Alabama coach Nick Saban said early in September.
But they skirted the larger questions around amateurism, and whether it would be appropriate for colleges to continue playing football if other students weren’t on campus.
“Faculty are cynical about football, but they don’t understand how many students come to Alabama because they don’t know where they want to go to college, but they know it’s fun.”
This is what it looked like to be a rule-following freshman during the first few weeks at the University of Alabama.
Three weeks into the semester, the school reported sanctioning three student organizations and 639 students—suspending 33—for violating COVID guidelines.
A student who works for university housing told me that he never received any updates from the administration on COVID policies.
On Aug. 16, just before classes started, photos circulated on social media of bars packed for a Greek life event, prompting the university to close sorority and fraternity houses to all except those who lived there and those who had meal plans (to-go only) there.
Meredith, a senior who lives in a sorority house and who has a medical condition putting her at higher risk, said she felt the university wasn’t doing enough to keep COVID-positive students away from the rest of the student body.
Early in the semester, as the university tried frantically to control the narrative around the case numbers, the school president, Stuart Bell, sent a scolding email to the student body.
On Oct. 1, the university announced that there had been just 24 positive tests that week.
“The university has talked about how the plans are working,” Brooke, the Alabama junior, told me.

file-40,"Like a lot of South American children, I grew up reading Mafalda comics.
Starring a group of little kids, the Argentine strip about the anxieties and misunderstandings of childhood was like Peanuts meets Calvin and Hobbes, then crossed with Doonesbury.
The comic offered plenty of sharp jokes about the world as kids see it, but with a twist: Mafalda was a politically passionate child.
This wasn’t that far-fetched: Quino and his wife relocated to Milan during the dictatorship, but the Argentine publishers of the Mafalda books and other children’s books were detained by the military government and spent a few months in prison for “indoctrinating” children.
Sad because the creator of those lovably pessimistic kindergartners was a Seussian moral force in South America, and strange because he ended the comic so long ago that it was a little surprising to learn he was still alive.
In Quino’s hands, the strip became, among other things, a time capsule of Argentine life during that particular decade: There is a statue of Mafalda on the street in the Buenos Aires neighborhood of San Telmo where she lived.
The building she occupied with her family—they lived in apartment E—has a plaque on it that says, “Mafalda Lived Here.” But despite its rootedness in a specific place and time, it’s also been a formative influence for several subsequent generations of children, partly because its multiple meanings accrue as those children grow up.
Many kids (like me) missed the full force of the jokes until they reread the comics and saw what they were saying about political problems or adult concerns.
I didn’t think it was that funny when Mafalda named her pet turtle Bureaucracy, called for it, and spent several panels waiting for it to arrive.
When a friend of Mafalda’s named Libertad tells Mafalda that her family’s last chicken was written by Sartre, I didn’t understand the setup.
Libertad, a comically tiny girl who sourly invites new acquaintances to get their jokes about her name out of their system, is a kind of parody of an intellectual’s disorganized, fiercely idealistic, and slightly impoverished life.
Mafalda herself is always sorting the people she observes into social categories or walks of life (“To what sector of democracy do cats belong?” she wonders in one panel), and her friend group reflects a similar interest in how different people approach the world.
They’re best-sellers.” “Best-sellers are books, man!” Felipe says.
Terrified of repeating whatever mistakes brought her to this pass, Mafalda frequently (and a little cruelly) asks her mother what she did to end up this way.
As for Mafalda, she likes playing, but there’s a geopolitical tilt to her games and observations.
I didn’t know what I was reading when I first started reading Mafalda.

One of the things we talked about when Constitution was off-Broadway was how the “me” in the title is really plural: The play is in some ways a conversation between your 15-year-old self and your, to quote the filmed version, “very late-40s” self.
Fifteen-year-old Heidi was so filled with hope and so optimistic and full of activist energy—which is of course, then, the thing that kind of breaks down over the course of the play and then in some ways reconstitutes itself, right?
You were onstage performing Constitution in the middle of Brett Kavanaugh’s confirmation hearings, and the filmed version is being released the week of Amy Coney Barrett’s hearings.
To whatever extent the show might get people to think about the importance of what’s going on right now, the fact that these hearings are going to be life and death for people, I guess I’m happy that it’s coming out now, if maybe there are people who don’t understand that.
I’m glad that the show is happening while this is happening, if it will motivate people to do … what, exactly, I don’t know, but understand the gravity of what is happening right now in those hearings.
If you think about the Voting Rights Act being in peril, that becomes life and death in a whole other way, in terms of the structural inequality in this country, racism.
It’s a very difficult time, I think, for most people to keep a sense of hope and also to maintain a kind of resilience.
I will say now, getting older and also performing the show for so many years, I really started to think about the constitutions of other countries, constitutions that were made in the 20th century, and the fact that almost all of them contain explicit human rights protections.
I think about that a lot, and I think about it with what’s going on with the court right now, because I think if, for example, our Constitution contained the Equal Rights Amendment that explicitly stated that there was no discrimination based on gender or sex, or if we had positive rights, for example, or that you can’t discriminate on the basis of race, or some countries have the right to clean air and water too—after performing the show for that long, I started to think about possible amendments to our Constitution that would protect human rights in this way.
Because it does feel like it’s absurd for those rights to be, one, in question, and, two, to be left up to, as I say in the play, the whims of nine people who weren’t even elected by us.
I would abolish the Electoral College, because I think a lot of the things we are facing right now have to do with a minority who has taken advantage of laws in the system to assert their will over a majority.
I don’t think this court, with six conservative justices, is going to represent the will of the American people, either.
If you look at the statistics, the majority of people don’t think Roe v.
The majority of people in general support things that these conservative justices want to overturn.
It’s sometimes said that a Supreme Court justice is one of the most powerful people in the world.
I feel like that has been a really hopeful sign.
You performed versions of What the Constitution Means to Me for over 10 years, but now that it’s been filmed, this is the version that will endure.
What do you think it will say about this time when people watch it 20 years from now?
My most fervent hope is that it feels like a relic, like, Oh, that was of a certain moment, one interesting little glimpse of that time before things got better.
I get up every day and I don’t feel like I can do that without having some glimmer of hope, you know?
It’s not just having kids—I mean, yes, of course, I want to have hope for my kids.
I feel like I want to do whatever small thing I can to help make this situation better.
And I think the act of doing things gives me hope.
And then secondly, I do think—and I want to be really careful about this because I don’t want to be Pollyanna—but I think the fact that these conversations have become more mainstream than ever, the fact that my conservative relatives can say Black lives matter, the fact that we’re having this really intense reckoning as a country where the past trauma is being faced and addressed and people are talking about it and feeling the import of it, I do think there’s possibly hope in that.
We have so much trauma that we haven’t faced, and we’re not like Germany or South Africa, who actually had ways to openly face and at least attempt to work through the grave human rights abuses perpetrated by their countries.
I feel like we’re on the brink of having that kind of reckoning, and maybe there’s a kind of healing that’s possible if we do that.","('constitution', 0.4286189267487377)","('heidi', 0.2285967609326601)","('i', 0.179137600912323)"
file-42,"Serpentine, a new book by Philip Pullman set in the universe of the His Dark Materials and The Book of Dust novels, is not properly a book at all.
It’s a short story with its page count plumped up with numerous (charming) engravings by Tom Duxbury, much like 2003’s Lyra’s Oxford and 2008’s Once Upon a Time in the North (both illustrated by John Lawrence) but without the nifty, intriguing extras included in those books: a fold-out map, a board game, and “documents” like postcards and letters alluding to the then-forthcoming Book of Dust.
Serpentine originated as an act of charity: an original, handwritten story by Pullman about Lyra Belacqua, auctioned off during the production of Nicholas Hytner’s stage adaptation of His Dark Materials in 2004, with the proceeds donated to worthy causes.
The story is set sometime between the end of The Amber Spyglass and the beginning of The Secret Commonwealth, while Lyra is an undergraduate at St. Sophia’s College in Oxford, and it describes a minor, uneventful encounter that nevertheless sets up some of the most wrenching aspects of The Book of Dust.
Sign up for the Slate Culture newsletter
What Lyra wants to know from Dr. Lanselius is how the witches, who all acquire the capacity to separate from their  daemons, broach the topic.
Although Serpentine does supply a glimpse of Pantalaimon’s adventures with Will Parry’s daemon while Lyra and Will are in the land of the dead, what actually happened to Pan after the separation matters less than Lyra’s growing awareness of the price they have paid for that trauma.
For the first time, Pan has had experiences Lyra knows nothing about, and the pair can be seen bickering and reproaching each other with a seriousness never evident in His Dark Materials.
“When I wrote Serpentine,” Pullman wrote in a statement for his publisher, “I had no idea that I was going on to write another trilogy, showing Lyra as an adult.” And in this 16-year-old story, he prefigured the painful estrangement between his heroine and her daemon that he had no inkling would feature in a future novel about Lyra’s adulthood.
Even more than Lyra’s Oxford and Once Upon a Time in the North, Serpentine is strictly for Pullman completists—newcomers to the Lyra novels will be entirely lost.
It’s a less impassioned performance than Michael Sheen’s readings of the two published volumes in The Book of Dust, but Colman’s self-possession suits Lyra at this stage in her life: thoughtful, careful, and all too aware that the true consequences of our actions cannot always be foreseen.

file-43,"Nathaniel Jones and Marisol Morales, tenants on rent strike at 1050 Carroll Pl. in the South Bronx.
COVID had shut down New York, dislodging the 54-year-old Bronx resident from her job at a Brooklyn restaurant where she cooked meals from her native Panama.
Morales shares a two-bedroom apartment at 1050 Carroll Pl., a large brick 1920s building on a dead-end block within walking distance of Yankee Stadium, with her daughter; her two sons are in the U.S. armed forces.
With April 1 looming, Morales realized she had two options: pay her portion of the rent or spend that money on food and electricity.
They’re among thousands of tenants across New York City and other U.S. metropolitan areas who’ve pursued rent strikes, an age-old bargaining tactic, during the pandemic.
Back in January, more than two dozen Carroll Place residents sued their landlord over mold, broken locks, and other problems with help from TakeRoot Justice, a legal services and advocacy organization, and the grassroots group Community Action for Safe Apartments.
“We didn’t really have a choice,” says Lopez, who’s 39 and has lived in the building for 15 years.
“If we don’t have any money for food, we need to focus on that before we can even think about rent,” Lopez says.
But it didn’t prevent the accumulation of rent debt, causing tenants like 37-year-old Ana Mejia to fret about their long-term prospects.
“We have very, very little money,” says Mejia, a mother of three who along with her husband stopped paying the $2,024 monthly rent for their three-bedroom apartment after they were laid off as line cooks.
“The immediate people at first, here in the Bronx, they weren’t family, but they were very close to me—friends of 10, 15, 20 years,” says Diaz.
One measure would suspend tenants’ rent obligations and small landlords’ mortgage obligations until 90 days after the state’s COVID emergency ends; another would stop evictions and foreclosures for a year following the emergency.
In the meantime, New York landlords can still sue tenants for missed rent, which could lead to money judgments, garnished wages, and reduced credit scores.
Even a recently enacted New York state “safe harbor” law, which offers tenants a legal defense against eviction and was separate from the state’s eviction ban, requires those with rent arrears to prove they suffered economic hardship from the pandemic.
New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo has just expanded that law to cover tenants subject to pre-pandemic eviction warrants, but only until January.
Ronald Whitaker, one of the tenants who sued the landlord for repairs and has participated in the rent strike.
Housing activists say that if people are on the hook for rents they can’t pay, a tsunami of new eviction filings will roll in, and these could harm tenants for life.
Since 2017, marshals have executed seven evictions at Carroll Place, according to the New York City Department of Investigation.
His rent for a one-bedroom apartment is about $950 a month, and he became active in the tenant association last year over concerns about water damage and mold.
“That’s why I’m in the rent strike with my fellow tenants,” he adds, “because I know I’m not the only person going through problems in this building.” (Jones’ apartment eventually received repairs with which he was satisfied.)
At a tenant association meeting in May, a large majority of members voted to endorse a formal rent strike beginning June 1.
That prompted the landlord, a Brooklyn-based limited liability company called Carroll Place Associates LLC, and its managing member, Yechiel Weinberger, to engage in negotiations.
Through an attorney, he declined to talk but issued a statement saying his company has worked “diligently to inspect and repair conditions alleged by tenants” and substantially renovated some apartments.
Tenant Gavino Lopez says the rent strike is about more than the clash with the management.
“If not everyone participates, it’s harder for those who are participating,” says Dulce Infante, a public school secretary who’s lived at Carroll Place for 19 years.
Over the summer, as New York’s COVID caseload slowed and the city began to reopen, the tenants’ rent strike kept going.
“One of our [association] meetings, it wasn’t just about the repairs and the landlord, it was more of ‘how can we help each other during the pandemic?’ ” says Dulce Infante, a 37-year-old resident who’s lived at Carroll Place since 2001.
The 36-year-old construction worker and his wife, who cleans banks, hadn’t been able to pay the $1,400 monthly rent for their two-bedroom apartment since he was laid off in April, and the manager was asking when they would pay up.
“It’s an intimidation tactic to say he came and did repairs and this is why I need to pay.” With a hearing in the tenants’ housing case approaching in early August, some reported receiving door knocks about rent.
This was the first time the tenants voiced their demands about rent relief and the management directly to Weinberger.
COVID Didn’t Destroy New York City.
Some started receiving 14-day rent demands—also called “pay or quit” notices—from the landlord, which often portend eviction cases.","('rent', 0.3979620605949233)","('tenants', 0.37281264670226893)","('carroll', 0.25455306749529694)"
file-44,"The gem show is such a big deal, in fact, that there aren’t enough hotel rooms in Tucson to accommodate everyone who comes to town for it, which makes the gem show a yearly windfall for people like Berger, who make money by renting out property on Airbnb.
Berger has been an Airbnb host for a few years now.
At the beginning of 2020, Berger had three Airbnb properties in Tucson, all of them single-unit dwellings.
“We wanted to close and get it furnished right before the gem show,” Berger says.
And by March 13, when President Donald Trump declared the COVID-19 crisis a full-fledged national emergency, Kelly Berger’s Airbnb business had completely collapsed.
As Airbnb has grown to dominate the world of short-term vacation rentals, people have become more familiar with the platform and thus more demanding about what they expect from their rentals.
They want a house that’s a blank slate with hotel amenities and no trace that anyone has ever actually lived there.
These days, if you stick around as an Airbnb host, chances are you do so because you’ve chosen to make it your business.
And if you’ve chosen to make short-term vacation rentals your business, you can’t not be on Airbnb.
But Airbnb remains the most popular platform for both hosts and guests.
The promise of Airbnb for travelers was that it would give them unique lodging experiences for less than they might pay at a hotel.
The promise for hosts was that they could be their own boss by renting out their existing assets on this platform whenever they felt like it.
“It was like I was a captain of a ship, and it was a nice ship and it was really sunny, and all of a sudden a torpedo hit the side of the ship, and we lost the vast majority of our business,” Airbnb co-founder Brian Chesky said back in June.
Many Airbnb hosts felt betrayed by a critical decision the platform made about its long-standing cancellation policy.
With certain exceptions for extenuating circumstances, Airbnb had always let its hosts set their own terms of cancellation.
Some hosts allowed travelers to cancel with a full refund up until 24 hours before check-in.
More than ever before, Airbnb had to choose between the hosts who list on its platform and the guests who book there.
“I was furious at the decision,” says Berger.
The decision prevented a PR disaster for the company, and it cost Airbnb a lot of money.","('airbnb', 0.6260190145000109)","('hosts', 0.3130095072500054)","('berger', 0.18780570435000324)"
file-45,"Last week, Caster Semenya lost her appeal of a rule by World Athletics (the governing body for international track and field) that established a testosterone limit for certain women in certain events.
In 2007, she won the women’s 50–54 age group at the USA Track and Field Club Cross Country Championships, but age and gender-graded performance standards continued to show that Harper was similarly competitive against women after testosterone suppression as she had been before it against men.
Harper believes that, absent medical intervention, Caster Semenya should not be allowed to compete in the women’s 800 meters.
She testified for World Athletics in the Court of Arbitration for Sport, or CAS, hearings that upheld the testosterone regulation.
In the Court of Arbitration for Sport hearings, Tucker was an expert witness for Athletics South Africa, which argued, along with Semenya’s team, to throw out the World Athletics testosterone rule.
Both Harper and Tucker believe that the female classification in sport is important to maintain and that there should be some criteria for entry into it that protects the integrity of women’s competition.
Part of the challenge is that women like Semenya with differences of sex development, or DSDs, sometimes have testosterone in the typical male range, or that falls between the typical male and female ranges.
Given that those classifications exist, they need to have some meaning, and there needs to be some dividing line between them.) When Harper and Tucker testified for opposite sides in the Semenya proceedings, it was regarding the research that World Athletics relied upon to create its particular testosterone rule.
Harper supported World Athletics and later wrote that “the verdict is congruent with my belief that both inclusion and meaningful sport for all women are important.”
It’s important to understand that the World Athletics rule doesn’t set a testosterone limit for all female competitors.
The rule only forces them to lower their testosterone levels if they want to compete against women in the 400, 800, and 1,500 meters.
Those are the events, World Athletics says, in which testosterone levels and performance, combined with other evidence—like the historical overrepresentation of women with DSDs in the 400, 800, and 1,500—suggest the clearest testosterone-linked advantage.
If Semenya opts to lower her testosterone, she can compete against women in those events.
But the World Athletics research also shows an advantage for women with elevated testosterone levels in the hammer throw and pole vault.
In a paper that Harper co-authored, researchers wrote that World Athletics may not have included the hammer and pole vault because athletes with DSDs have not been as significantly overrepresented on the Olympic medal stand as they have been in the other events.
It also suggests that World Athletics realizes it is not drawing some bright line between men and women for all sports.
On the other hand, it’s an awkward fit with the idea that testosterone is the primary driver of the male advantage in all events, and with the pretty consistent 10 percent performance gap between the fastest men and the fastest women at all distances.
World Athletics has argued that, as it pertains to the 800, Semenya has all the physiological advantages of a male runner.
(Her times in the event wouldn’t be nearly world class for a man, but they would be good enough for her to compete on a men’s college team.) I think it’s good for athletes, sports fans, and society to have fair women’s competition at the elite level.
If Semenya wants to try to defend her Olympic title, she would have to undergo testosterone suppression for no medical reason.
Harper and Tucker may soon be on different sides of another legal battle in sports, about transgender athletes in rugby.
Based on that report, World Rugby just proposed banning transgender women from women’s competition.
Harper and Tucker—and I—all think that having guidelines in Olympic sports and the NCAA that require athletes transitioning from male to female to undergo testosterone suppression (if they want to compete in the women’s category) is reasonable.
Harper has floated the idea of allowing transgender girls who have not undergone testosterone suppression to compete against girls in high school track but not at the state championship level.
Last week, Harper explained to me, “I think that in most—but not all—matters, we should use gender identity to divide people into male and female categories.”
I think Harper and Tucker must be comfortable with it too, which is why they can take positions in track and rugby that might look contradictory from the outside.","('testosterone', 0.4743910068129645)","('harper', 0.3672704568874564)","('athletics', 0.2754528426655923)"
file-46,"Job growth slowed drastically in September, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported, as employers added just 661,000 workers to their payrolls, less than half the number they hired the month before.
After its rapid early stages, in which shuttered businesses first began to reopen and millions of Americans got back to the grind, the country’s big rebound is pretty clearly losing momentum.
Someone absolutely hellbent on finding optimistic news in this jobs report might point to the unemployment rate, which did fall from 8.4 to 7.9 percent.
The government only counts people as “unemployed” if they are both out of a job and searching for work.
But at this point, many Americans have been sidelined entirely from the job market.
The overall share of Americans with a job was nearly flat in September.
Some of that may be due to the fact that small businesses have burned through the aid that Congress passed in the spring; the Paycheck Protection Program was only designed to last for about two months, after all, and we are way, way past that point.
The weekly $600 federal unemployment benefits that kept many families financially stable through the first several months of the crisis expired at the end of July.

file-48,"Cubs superfan Ronnie “Woo-Woo” Wickers outside Wrigley Field on Wednesday.
After a weird, truncated regular season in which their most notable accomplishment was having none of their players contract COVID-19, the Chicago Cubs made the MLB playoffs for the fifth time in the past six years.
In normal times, I would have been inside Wrigley Field for the first game of their series against the Miami Marlins, roaming the aisles as a beer vendor.
And so, on Wednesday, I went to see what it’d be like to follow a playoff game from the streets outside Wrigley Field.
On game days, Wrigleyville is usually thronged with people in Cubs gear, with each new arrival of the elevated train disgorging hundreds of new fans.
After 20 seasons of vending at Wrigley Field and a lifetime of going to games there, the sights and sounds of the neighborhood are imprinted on my mind.
Going to a game is in part an act of reconnecting with my own memories, and the fixtures of Wrigleyville are living avatars of those memories: the ruddy-faced scalper who circles the neighborhood on his bicycle, muttering “Who needs two?”; the independent peanut vendor who implores fans to “get ’em on the OUT-side, you’ll save MON-ey”; the hydrant outside the firehouse on Waveland, which the firefighters rig up as a makeshift water fountain.
The ballhawks were there, as usual: about a dozen middle-aged men with folding chairs and baseball gloves on the street beyond the left field bleachers, waiting to snag any home runs that flew out of the park.
There were a few other fans, too, mostly on the rooftops of the apartment buildings on Waveland and Sheffield avenues, which offer bird’s-eye views inside the stadium below.
On one roof, a guy gamely banged a cowbell until he lost interest and stopped.
At the corner of Addison and Sheffield, outside the Sports Corner bar, merchandise vendor Byron Yablon stood muttering to himself as Van Halen’s “Jump” wafted from the stadium.
The Cubs used to play this song before every single game, until one of their relief pitchers begged them to stop.
“They’ve been playing a lot of the old stuff this year,” Yablon said.
Yablon has been selling gear at Wrigley for 23 years.
In all that time he’d missed only a handful of games.
You got 600 people on the rooftops in a stadium that seats 40,000.
It felt like time to start drinking, so I stopped into Murphy’s Bleachers.
At a corner table, three bros pounded light beer and paid no attention to the game.
I moved on to Lucky Dorr, a newish bar on the ground floor of a Cubs office building on Waveland, where a dozen people sat watching the game on television.
Outside the Addison L stop, Clark Street Sports was boarded up, and the neighboring ticket brokerage had a “no trespassing” sign on the door.
This almost feels normal, I thought, before I left the bar, lest he come and lean on me.
Back in 2003, the last time the Cubs played the Marlins in the playoffs, Wrigleyville was coursing with excitement.
The stadium was packed for every game of that National League Championship Series, and the fans who couldn’t get inside filled the bars and streets.
In Game 6, a foul ball in the left field boxes resulted in the most famous act of fan interference in baseball history.
Fears of COVID-19 surely kept people away from Wrigley Field on Wednesday.
This year, baseball felt like a simulacrum, the season happening in places we’d been before but that were now just out of reach.
The games were broadcast from the uncanny valley, with all the people that give live baseball its warmth and character—fans in the seats, vendors in the stands—disappeared.
The Cubs were playing in a kind of fantasy Chicago, one that might as well have been built on a sound stage on another planet.","('cubs', 0.4482702071722844)","('wrigley', 0.20919276334706602)","('yablon', 0.17930808286891373)"
file-49,"This article is excerpted from She Come by It Natural: Dolly Parton and the Women Who Lived Her Songs by Sarah Smarsh.
Excerpted with permission by Scribner, a Division of Simon & Schuster, Inc. The fourth of 12 siblings, Dolly Parton was born on a small farm in 1946; her father, Lee, paid the doctor a bag of grain for the delivery.
Of her many hits, Parton has described that tribute to her mother, Avie Lee, as the one most special to her.
She says she got her musical talent from that side of her family, whom she describes as “dreamers.” During Parton’s childhood, radios, record players, and electricity hadn’t yet reached the rural poor, and they entertained themselves in their own homes with old ways passed down from European country peasantry.
In one hit from her early career, “Applejack,” which she has said portrays a composite of real people, she tells of visiting a mountain-music man who gifted her his banjo when he died—a bit of Africa that had reached East Tennessee over the centuries.
While Parton’s musicianship and mentorship came from her mother’s family, her business acumen, she says, came from her father—a tenderhearted lifelong laborer who didn’t learn to read and write but nonetheless was savvy with a horse trade and could stretch a bit of money a long way.
That production stripped away the razzle-dazzle of backup bands and big sets featured on so many of her tours, putting Parton on a mostly bare stage with three backup musicians and a few cascades of white fabric.
At one point during the performance, Parton climbed a few steps to sit on a white platform described as a front porch but that turned out to be an elevated position for communing with heaven.
Before singing “Smoky Mountain Memories,” her 1978 song about poor workers drawn north during the midcentury factory boom, she paid tribute to her father’s hard work, economic decisions, and commitment to his family.
One imagines Parton, who told the crowd her family had running water “if we ran and got it,” absorbed her wit and natural poetry from her mother’s language.
“It wasn’t any of this, ‘please be my darling wife.’ Sheeeeit,” she said, and we both cracked up—not at our own family’s misfortunes but at the delusions of women who got a sentimental proposal and a big diamond before they spent a lifetime pushing a vacuum.
That darkness in a woman’s voice, plain stories of hell on Earth sung by women who have little to carry them forward but faith, is the divine feminine of American roots music.
“Little Sparrow,” from her 2001 album by the same name, blends the bluegrass, folk, and country gospel sounds of her native home and is sung in the voice of a jilted, devastated woman warning young girls to “never trust the hearts of men.” As haunting as the melody is, Parton—who is given to undercutting serious moments with an endearing bit of nervous humor—sets it up with a joke onstage: “I call it my little sad-ass song.”
Parton says you can’t be from where she’s from and not like woeful melodies.
But Parton insists that, in practice, her home was so rich in love that every material poverty was mitigated.
After the moving tribute to her musical mother and industrious father, at another stop on the same tour—in Austin, Texas—Parton made her way down the steps of the “porch” before it was wheeled offstage.
While the fast beat pulsed and one of her band members played another banjo, Parton tapped the air with her bow like a conductor.
Right before her solo, she pointed the bow at the cowboy and said in time with the rhythm, “You dance.” The sexy cowboy hooked his thumbs into the belt loops of his tight jeans and kicked up his heels in place while she fiddled, and the crowd roared.
Parton spends more time than the average performer onstage deferring to others with what, by all known accounts, is a sincere humility—praising the crowd, thanking her own band, honoring her family and her roots.
Sex was the third formative pillar of her life alongside music and religion, Parton said in her 1994 autobiography, My Life and Other Unfinished Business.
In that space of music, sex, and God, Parton wrote, she experienced a spiritual epiphany that “it was all right for me to be a sexual being.” Indeed, she has described herself as having been hormonally precocious both inside and out.
When her mother suggested she’d been possessed, Parton told her to give credit where it was due—not to Satan but to Dolly herself.
What women who didn’t grow up on a farm might miss is that, where Parton was from, this common act of female adolescent rebellion wasn’t just about attracting boys.
“[Glamorous women in magazines] didn’t look as if men and boys could just put their hands on them anytime they felt like it, and with any degree of roughness they chose.
My family’s poverty was nothing like Parton’s, but it was enough that I knew shame.
For women in poverty, though, it is not just a song but a way of life, not just a performance but a necessity.
As with Loretta Lynn, Tammy Wynette, Patsy Cline, and so many female country performers before and since, Parton’s music expresses this.

The comic offered plenty of sharp jokes about the world as kids see it, but with a twist: Mafalda was a politically passionate child.
This wasn’t that far-fetched: Quino and his wife relocated to Milan during the dictatorship, but the Argentine publishers of the Mafalda books and other children’s books were detained by the military government and spent a few months in prison for “indoctrinating” children.
Sad because the creator of those lovably pessimistic kindergartners was a Seussian moral force in South America, and strange because he ended the comic so long ago that it was a little surprising to learn he was still alive.
In Quino’s hands, the strip became, among other things, a time capsule of Argentine life during that particular decade: There is a statue of Mafalda on the street in the Buenos Aires neighborhood of San Telmo where she lived.
The building she occupied with her family—they lived in apartment E—has a plaque on it that says, “Mafalda Lived Here.” But despite its rootedness in a specific place and time, it’s also been a formative influence for several subsequent generations of children, partly because its multiple meanings accrue as those children grow up.
Many kids (like me) missed the full force of the jokes until they reread the comics and saw what they were saying about political problems or adult concerns.
I didn’t think it was that funny when Mafalda named her pet turtle Bureaucracy, called for it, and spent several panels waiting for it to arrive.
When a friend of Mafalda’s named Libertad tells Mafalda that her family’s last chicken was written by Sartre, I didn’t understand the setup.
Libertad, a comically tiny girl who sourly invites new acquaintances to get their jokes about her name out of their system, is a kind of parody of an intellectual’s disorganized, fiercely idealistic, and slightly impoverished life.
Mafalda herself is always sorting the people she observes into social categories or walks of life (“To what sector of democracy do cats belong?” she wonders in one panel), and her friend group reflects a similar interest in how different people approach the world.
They’re best-sellers.” “Best-sellers are books, man!” Felipe says.
Terrified of repeating whatever mistakes brought her to this pass, Mafalda frequently (and a little cruelly) asks her mother what she did to end up this way.
As for Mafalda, she likes playing, but there’s a geopolitical tilt to her games and observations.
I didn’t know what I was reading when I first started reading Mafalda.
It may say something about us that a comic set in 1960s Argentina feels more relevant today than it did when I first read it.","('mafalda', 0.481312466945878)","('her', 0.28790209488217905)","('comic', 0.19252498677835117)"
file-52,"Amelie Bea Smith as Flora, Benjamin Evan Ainsworth as Miles, and T’Nia Miller as Hannah in The Haunting of Bly Manor.
Like The Haunting of Hill House before it, The Haunting of Bly Manor hinges on a fifth episode that casts everything we’ve seen in a different light and reframes the series for its second half.
But where Hill House’s “The Bent-Neck Lady” revealed that one of the story’s core characters had effectively been haunting herself, traveling through time in a futile attempt to warn herself of her impending death, Bly Manor’s “The Altar of the Dead” reveals that the Gothic mansion’s housekeeper, Hannah Grose (T’Nia Miller), is already dead when the story starts.
At the end of “The Altar of the Dead,” Hannah is pushed into a well by 10-year-old Miles (Benjamin Evan Ainsworth), the haunted scion of Bly Manor’s late lord and lady.
Because the series’s first four episodes hop backward and forward in time, it’s easy to overlook the way it avoids having Hannah physically interact with the other characters.
(There are several other figures who won’t be introduced until the series’s penultimate episode, which finally reveals the tragic backstory of the house’s faceless big bad, the Lady in the Lake.) But there among them is a doll that clearly represents Hannah Grose, in the red sweater and green skirt she’s wearing when we meet her, the clothes that still adorn the body at the bottom of the well.
Bly Manor, like Hill House, uses its flashback-heavy early episodes to flesh out its major characters, so when “The Altar of the Dead” starts showing us pieces of Hannah’s previous life, it feels as if we’re in for more of the same.
In the kitchen, Hannah is wearing red again—a blouse this time instead of a sweater, but virtually the same color as the outfit she died in—and when Owen walks in, she seems confused, like an actor who’s lost her place in the script.
The rest of the episode moves her through time as if she’s physically traversing it, the way the bravura long take in Hill House’s “Two Storms” moved seamlessly from a funeral home in the present to a haunted mansion decades past.
Like the episodes before it, “The Altar of the Dead” fills in its central character’s backstory, but unlike those, it never leaves the grounds of Bly Manor.
The Haunting of Hill House was at heart a story about childhood trauma, and at its core Bly Manor is about regret.
Although the series quickly departs from the premise laid out by Henry James’ The Turn of the Screw—the show is officially based on “the work of Henry James,” since it incorporates elements from his other ghost stories—it shares with that novella that it’s a story about the English authored by an American, premised on the idea that letting tradition stop you from reinventing yourself is a good way to end up in an early grave.
In a cruelly poignant twist, the end of the episode takes us back to the opening moment by the campfire, when a very tipsy Owen mulls returning to Paris to continue his culinary training, and just about works up the nerve to ask Hannah to come with him.
(Without spoiling the very ending of Bly Manor, I can say that the last shot is very nearly the same as the first, but with one crucial difference.) The dead can only retrace their steps, hoping they’ve lived enough good moments to linger in.","('hannah', 0.6097315981513796)","('bly', 0.34144969496477257)","('owen', 0.17072484748238628)"

They discussed how novelists do research, what goes into the different stages of publishing a book, and what it’s like to write from different perspectives.
June Thomas: When you’re writing, do you think, What would this character’s favorite novel be?
It makes me think of certain kinds of actors who are so committed to losing themselves in a performance that they won’t take off the costume, or they’ll read the book that their character might have on their bedside table.
She’s saying what I feel about a work of art, but that doesn’t mean that I am Ruth or she is me.
Similarly, when I think of the characters in Leave the World Behind, at least one thing about each one pops into my mind.
It could be a habit they have: Clay’s a smoker; Ruth likes Swan Lake.
I don’t know if I was thinking about distilling them down to a particular tic or habit or some facts from which you could extrapolate meaning.
But something that I have only realized lately is that when writing a book, most of the work of the book is being done by the reader.
The endeavor of this book is certainly to establish a sense that these people are not fake, that you could know them, that you could have a feeling about them.

But no one seems to agree on the exact terms; Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell are offering and saying completely different things.
But the important thing is that a White House deal now appears to be on the table, one far more substantial than Senate Republicans’ “skinny” relief.
And Jordan Weissmann, Slate’s senior business and economics correspondent, thinks Democrats need to take it now: “If we do not have a deal, a lot of people are going to suffer this winter.
On Wednesday’s episode of What Next, I spoke with Weissmann about the White House’s new stimulus proposal, the political warfare that’s dogged this process, and why it’s imperative for Democrats to stop worrying and love the new offer.
Mary Harris: The last time you were on, you were basically saying there’s no chance a coronavirus stimulus passes because the government is just too stuck.
Then people told him that it looked bad and he overcompensated by going the other direction, saying “throw as much money as you want.” So the White House got a bit nervous because the markets weren’t looking so good, poll numbers for the election weren’t so great, and Trump has been having a perpetual freakout ever since.
Are there any good studies looking at how long that unemployment could last, and whether doing a deal now could benefit folks not just for the next few months but longer?
The president wants a big stimulus because it’s nice to have checks going out right before an election.
Even Kudlow said the president wants to offer more than Nancy Pelosi.
I don’t understand why you wouldn’t at least throw it to the Senate and say, “Are you going to deny aid to millions and millions of unemployed Americans?” If they sign the deal, great—Pelosi got pretty close to what she wanted to get.
If they don’t sign the deal, she can continue attacking McConnell for it, just make him own that at the very least, pin it firmly on him and the Republican Party.
Trump Wants a Stimulus Deal Again.
It could be good for them to get a deal at the White House, on the condition that Trump starts putting the screws to Mitch McConnell.
It doesn’t really seem like there’s a bad option here in taking more or less what the White House has on offer.
You can negotiate specific things, like how the White House wants liability protections that will prevent workers from suing their employers if they get infected with COVID on the job.
And the basic shape of what’s on offer looks pretty good.
It seems like this is something that the House Democrats should want to do.
Do we have evidence that the president is willing to compromise on things he may not want to spend money on, like sending aid to New York and California?

Victoria Neuman, the truth-speaking young congresswoman played by Claudia Doumit, who had worked with the vigilante Boys in their efforts to bring down the evil Vought Enterprises, turns out to be a secret superhero.
In fact, the terrible scene we were subjected to in Episode 7—a Congressional hearing Neuman calls in order to bring Vought Industries to justice ends in a huge mess as the star witness and multiple attendees get their gourds squished by an invisible force—was all Neuman’s doing.
The comic-book series the show’s drawn from had a character named “Victor Neuman,” but he was a dim-witted Vought exec turned politician, apparently inspired by George W.

“Didn’t you love that little ‘Walk Like an Egyptian’ dance she did online?” he asks the crowd, a seeming reference to that time a video of AOC dancing adorably to Phoenix’s “Lisztomania” on a rooftop in college went viral.
I loved it!” Homelander, an old-school sociopath deeply uncomfortable with the workings of online celebrity, did not in fact “love it”—but the crowd, full of people hoisting signs that say “We love you, Victoria!,” clearly did.
What a bunch of corrupt fucking cunts they are!” Neuman replies, casually: “You’re not the first to call me a cunt, Mr. Butcher; I’m starting to think it’s like a badge of honor.” Rep. Ted Yoho called Ocasio-Cortez “a fucking bitch” on the Capitol steps in July of this year, so this can’t have been an explicit connection since this season of the show was already in the can, but Ocasio-Cortez certainly gets enough abuse online to make the connection resonate.
Looking back at the times Neuman appeared this season, I’m not sure why I didn’t call this turn ahead of time.
The reveal that Victoria Neuman is a head-squishing supe works within the universe of The Boys, because nobody but the Boys (and maybe the good superhero, Starlight, and Grace Mallory) are allowed to have pure hearts.
When we find out she’s a supe secretly working against the Boys, Victoria Neuman’s force of personality—the leadership qualities that draw people to attend the rallies she convenes, toting signs that say “Victoria Neuman, Political Badass”—becomes instantly suspicious.

file-56,"Kawhi Leonard struggles in the lane in Game 7 of the Western Conference second round of the NBA playoffs at AdventHealth Arena in Lake Buena Vista, Florida, on Tuesday.
I’ve never been in Las Vegas to watch the controlled implosion of a casino, but I imagine it was a bit like scrolling through Twitter on Tuesday during the Los Angeles Clippers’ Game 7 loss to the Denver Nuggets.
It’s not every day that you get to see championship favorites blow a 3–1 series lead while only scoring 33 points in the second half of the elimination game, but the Clippers delivered the goods.
After securing the services of Kawhi Leonard in free agency last offseason, they traded promising young star Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and three future first-round picks (as well as the right to swap picks in 2023 and 2025) to Oklahoma City for All-Star forward Paul George.
The Clippers mortgaged their future on George’s ability to help them win games immediately.

They should have gone far, which is why many, including longtime NBA reporter Howard Beck and former player (and current ESPN analyst) Matt Barnes argued that the title would go through the Clippers this year.
It’s a shame the Clippers make for such a fun pile-on, because the Denver Nuggets truly deserve all the credit in the world.
Guard Jamal Murray scored 40 points in Game 7, which is more than George and Leonard’s combined total (24 points.
(His final stat line: 16 points, 22 rebounds, 13 assists.) The Clippers had no match for Jokic, and it’s worth noting that the best player in a series that included Kawhi Leonard was a guy who runs like he’s chasing a bus he doesn’t actually want to catch.

The Lakers may look like the Clippers in that they feature two superstars, but LeBron James and Anthony Davis’ squad is nothing like their fellow Angelenos.
Unlike the Clippers, the Lakers brushed aside their brief encounters with adversity.
But when the Portland Trail Blazers triumphed in Game 1 of their opening round matchup, the Lakers responded by winning the next four.
This sequence repeated itself in the Western Conference semifinals, and Los Angeles made such easy work of the Rockets that Houston’s coach decided to become a free agent almost immediately after Game 5.

If you believe in multiverse theory—and which NBA fan doesn’t?—then you know that, in some dimension, Morris actually did pass the ball to LeBron.
Had Morris found him on the opposite wing, he would’ve had more than just an open shot.
He would’ve had a chance to make a Finals-winning jumper, one that would usurp the 2016 chase-down block on Andre Iguodala as the play that defines his legacy.
For that to happen, Morris would’ve had to get him the ball on time and on target.

file-58,"Democrats are pretty clearly about to spend the month until Election Day using Donald Trump’s $750 tax bill as a rhetorical nunchuck, whacking him with it whenever they get an opening.
The morning after the New York Times published its blockbuster report on the president’s filings, Joe Biden was already selling buttons that read “I paid more income taxes than Donald Trump.” They cost $7.50.
In the longer term, though, our president’s adventures in tax avoidance should also provide a great opportunity to build political momentum for rebuilding our our battered, broken-down Internal Revenue Service, a policy item that should be high on Democrats’ to-do list if they retake power.
A decade of budget cuts and massive staff reductions have badly weakened the IRS, stripping it of the resources necessary to police frauds, and slowing audits to a trickle.
Somewhat surprisingly, Trump’s own Treasury secretary, Steve Mnuchin, has been a voice of reason in recent years, making the case for restoring the IRS’s funding, telling Congress it was “understaffed” and “under-resourced.” But given the GOP’s history on the issue, it seems likely that any effort to seriously rebuild the agency will be met with conservative opposition and hysterics.
In response, Democrats can now point to the president’s taxes.
We do not know for sure whether Trump himself has broken any tax laws, though the New York Times’ investigation certainly raises the possibility over and over.
But Trump seems to have aggressively gamed the tax code in other ways too, by claiming deductions that the New York Times suggests he may not have been entitled to.
He wrote off millions of dollars of property taxes for Seven Springs, his mansion in Westchester County, New York, as a business expense, even though his son Eric has described it as a family “compound.” Based on the paper’s reporting, it appears he paid his daughter Ivanka phantom “consulting fees” for projects she would have worked on as an employee of the Trump Organization, a move that could have lowered the president’s liability while simultaneously skirting gift taxes.
In a better, more reasonable timeline, businessmen like Trump would be scared out of these sorts of tax games, because we’d have a well-funded, aggressive IRS checking and double-checking their returns regularly for suspicious signs of fraud.","('tax', 0.38655387285468984)","('irs', 0.26381038830905207)","('budget', 0.181418542399665)"
file-59,"The explosive New York Times report on Donald Trump’s tax returns confirms a great number of things about the president’s finances we’ve only been able to speculate about for years.
One of the most stunning revelations—beyond the headline figure that Trump paid only $750 in taxes in 2016 and again in 2017—is of Trump’s attempt to get a refund from the IRS for $72 million in 2010 by claiming $1.4 billion in losses in 2008 and 2009, which would not only justify the refund but also wipe out any income tax he would owe for years to come.
We learned from tax returns leaked in the runup to the 2016 election that Donald Trump claimed a $915.7 million loss in 1995, which he used to avoid paying taxes for about 10 years.
The earlier loss was related to his failed casino business: Trump borrowed about $1 billion and lost it.
The result was that Trump got to earn about $1 billion of income going forward and pay no tax on it until 2005.
If Trump prevails in claiming this second massive loss, he will have succeeded in paying almost nothing in income taxes on more than $2 billion of income.
According to the Times, Trump claimed to have abandoned a partnership interest in that same floundering casino business, generating the loss.
We have no way of knowing whether the IRS audited Trump back in the 1990s, when he claimed the first loss.
It’s one thing to avoid taxes you should pay by understating your income or claiming a loss that can be carried forward.
Given the possibility of fraud (indeed, there is a cottage industry among some inmates of filing false refund claims so they can bilk the government), Congress wisely requires that all large tax refund requests be reviewed and approved by the Joint Committee on Taxation, a technocratic, nonpartisan organization that supports both the House and Senate when it comes to tax matters.
The New York Times reports that there was a possible settlement in 2014 but that it never happened, and that the committee’s review expanded to include subsequent years, where any unused losses would apply to reduce future income taxes.
If he prevails in claiming this second massive loss, he will have succeeded in paying almost nothing in income taxes on more than $2 billion of income.
With an election he’s losing entering its final stretch, the audit still outstanding, and more than $400 million in personally guaranteed debt coming due, it may finally be time for Trump to pay up.","('tax', 0.3044133718392852)","('income', 0.2554510961735813)","('trump', 0.21772781468344346)"
file-60,"Arguing that “housing stability helps protect public health” in a pandemic, the agency issued a nationwide ban on evictions for nonpayment of rent until the end of the year.
But as policymakers race to figure out how to deliver rental assistance and other relief to the tens of millions of families who could face eviction come January 1, they are discovering an inconvenient fact: eviction data is so bad there’s often no way to tell who is most at risk of losing their home, where they live, or how much back rent they’re likely to be evicted over.
Real-time data on which cities, counties, and neighborhoods are seeing the highest eviction rates could help municipal leaders direct rent assistance funds, lobby for additional federal and state funds for hard-hit cities and counties, and prioritize whose doors to knock on to get the word out about assistance programs.
Local data on how much back rent tenants owe would allow Congress to determine with specificity the amount of assistance renters in each state would need.
Whereas Princeton’s Eviction Lab has created a publicly available (albeit limited) national dataset on evictions, foreclosure data is largely hidden behind the paywalls of for-profit companies like Attom Data and CoreLogic.
Indeed, a new report from New America that I co-authored finds that one in three U.S. counties have no available data on how many people lose their homes through eviction and foreclosure each year.
Without critical information about where in the county evictions and foreclosures take place, or who is most impacted, municipal leaders are flying blind as they attempt to deploy diminishing amounts of pandemic aid.
But no such mandate exists for collecting data on how people lose their homes.
But there’s no profit in providing public data on how many people have lost their homes through eviction and mortgage foreclosures.
For one, without knowing how many people are losing their homes and where they live, municipal leaders can’t prioritize housing aid and outreach.
Even for-profit aggregators like Attom Data have no foreclosure records for 400 U.S. counties.
Experts estimate that natural disasters cause more than 1 million Americans to lose their homes annually, but these rough estimates say nothing about where the housing loss occurred or what happened to the people displaced.
For example: in the uproar over the nation’s eviction crisis, we have lost sight of the fact that nearly 700,000 households lose their homes to mortgage foreclosure every year.
We need national eviction and foreclosure databases.
It is likely that millions of people are impacted, but they are invisible to courts, researchers and aid agencies.

file-61,"Serpentine, a new book by Philip Pullman set in the universe of the His Dark Materials and The Book of Dust novels, is not properly a book at all.
It’s a short story with its page count plumped up with numerous (charming) engravings by Tom Duxbury, much like 2003’s Lyra’s Oxford and 2008’s Once Upon a Time in the North (both illustrated by John Lawrence) but without the nifty, intriguing extras included in those books: a fold-out map, a board game, and “documents” like postcards and letters alluding to the then-forthcoming Book of Dust.
Serpentine originated as an act of charity: an original, handwritten story by Pullman about Lyra Belacqua, auctioned off during the production of Nicholas Hytner’s stage adaptation of His Dark Materials in 2004, with the proceeds donated to worthy causes.
The story is set sometime between the end of The Amber Spyglass and the beginning of The Secret Commonwealth, while Lyra is an undergraduate at St. Sophia’s College in Oxford, and it describes a minor, uneventful encounter that nevertheless sets up some of the most wrenching aspects of The Book of Dust.

What Lyra wants to know from Dr. Lanselius is how the witches, who all acquire the capacity to separate from their  daemons, broach the topic.
Although Serpentine does supply a glimpse of Pantalaimon’s adventures with Will Parry’s daemon while Lyra and Will are in the land of the dead, what actually happened to Pan after the separation matters less than Lyra’s growing awareness of the price they have paid for that trauma.
For the first time, Pan has had experiences Lyra knows nothing about, and the pair can be seen bickering and reproaching each other with a seriousness never evident in His Dark Materials.
“When I wrote Serpentine,” Pullman wrote in a statement for his publisher, “I had no idea that I was going on to write another trilogy, showing Lyra as an adult.” And in this 16-year-old story, he prefigured the painful estrangement between his heroine and her daemon that he had no inkling would feature in a future novel about Lyra’s adulthood.
Even more than Lyra’s Oxford and Once Upon a Time in the North, Serpentine is strictly for Pullman completists—newcomers to the Lyra novels will be entirely lost.
It’s a less impassioned performance than Michael Sheen’s readings of the two published volumes in The Book of Dust, but Colman’s self-possession suits Lyra at this stage in her life: thoughtful, careful, and all too aware that the true consequences of our actions cannot always be foreseen.

file-63,"Aaron Sorkin, bard of blowhards, poet of patriotism, orchestrator of countless West Wing walk and talks and ripped-from-the-headlines clashes of ideas, is either the exact right or exact wrong writer for our highly unsubtle historical moment.
Sacha Baron Cohen brings energy and goofy verve to what might otherwise be (and sometimes is) a stodgy courtroom drama.
The Trial of the Chicago 7 (which begins streaming on Netflix on Friday) is only Sorkin’s second time around both writing and directing a feature film, and though he continues to be better at the former than the latter, the new movie is more ambitious and livelier than the sharply written but clunkily paced Molly’s Game.
This is in effect an all-star biopic, the story of not seven but eight ’60s counterculture figures who endured a protracted and highly publicized trial after the protests of the 1968 Democratic National Convention in Chicago turned violent.
Some, like Tom Hayden (Eddie Redmayne), were idealistic student organizers in the movement against the Vietnam War. Others, like Abbie Hoffman (Sacha Baron Cohen) and Jerry Rubin (Jeremy Strong), came from a more radical wing of the left, the pranksterish group Hoffman dubbed the Youth International Party, or the “Yippies.”

The range of approaches to protest among these groups—including the militant anti-racist Panthers, represented by Seale and his second-in-command Fred Hampton (Kelvin Harrison Jr.)—provides a springboard for any number of Sorkinian debates, some in the formal atmosphere of the courtroom, some in informal settings where the young activists butt heads.
Moreover, clips of the real-life Hoffman show that, big as Baron Cohen plays the character, the actor isn’t just hamming it up: The charismatic leader worked audiences at public events with the timing of a stand-up comic.
The film’s uninterrogated gender politics represent one of many ways in which The Trial of the Chicago 7, for all its firebrand banter, remains a fundamentally traditionalist movie.
But watching it at a moment when the majority of the population is moving leftward while our institutions are held hostage by a far-right minority—and when police violence continues, unchecked and unprosecuted, in the streets—provides the vicarious pleasure of watching a bunch of hyperarticulate progressives speak truth to power, and it feels pretty damn good, even if they do all talk a lot like Aaron Sorkin.

file-64,"LeBron James celebrates an offline accomplishment.
It’s taken him 17 long seasons, but LeBron James will finally be playing in his 10th NBA Finals.
It was a true team effort, with James and JaVale McGee combining to put up 38 points, 17 rebounds, and 10 assists.
That’s good, LeBron, because for me, personally, your job is not done, either.
Nevertheless, LeBron would like us to believe that his age somehow makes him special.
“I think people have just grown accustomed of what I do and it gets taken for granted at times what I do because I do it so often and it’s been a constant thing for so long,” he said.
For some, LeBron has already done enough to be considered an all-time great.
“LeBron is one of the most dynamic and charismatic players in the history of the NBA,” Kareem Abdul-Jabbar has said.
“LeBron James to me, when you think about all-around basketball players, he’s probably the best of all time,” claimed Magic Johnson.
All due respect to Kareem and Magic, but I’ve been watching the NBA since Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Magic Johnson ruled the league.
Yes, I’ve seen LeBron’s various “feats.” I watched a 22-year-old LeBron score 25 straight points to close out the Pistons in Game 5 of the 2007 Eastern Conference Finals.
Those were all great moments, sure, but they happened at specific points within the unceasing flow of time.
So, what can LeBron do to make me appreciate his greatness?","('lebron', 0.22878912225882356)","('kareem', 0.1906700976519507)","('abdul-jabbar', 0.1271133984346338)"
file-65,"Like many progressives, I’ve taken a lot of delight in watching the House speaker and her fellow Democrats stand their ground these past few months as they’ve negotiated with the White House (and, more indirectly, with feckless Senate Republicans) over the next batch of coronavirus aid.
Unlike previous rounds of relief talks, where they were willing to give up key demands in the name of passing something to avert looming catastrophe, Pelosi and company have simply refused to cave on issues like providing support to state and local governments, working from the premise that, this time around, a bad bill would be worse than no bill at all.
Last week, Pelosi rejected a $1.6 trillion offer from the White House.
But on Tuesday, Donald Trump abruptly announced that he was pulling the plug on talks until after the election, and told Senate Republicans to focus in the meantime on confirming Judge Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court.
On Twitter Tuesday evening, he demanded that Congress pass individual bits of relief legislation that he would support, like a new batch of $1,200 checks to Americans.
“It’s not going to happen.”) And now, the president seems to be feeling some regret: He’s reportedly told House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy that he once again wants a big deal, and Pelosi and Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin are back to discussing whether a comprehensive agreement might be possible.
After all, the politics of all this are absolutely abysmal for the president, who—let’s say it again—got loaded on meds and publicly ordered his party to spend its time hustling his Supreme Court nominee onto the bench instead of doing something to help struggling families and businesses in the middle of a pandemic, before impotently wailing for Democrats to just pass the parts of a bill he likes, and is now presently in the mood to negotiate again.
He looks, in short, like an erratic moron whom nobody in their right mind would want to deal with, which can’t possibly help his poll numbers.
Without government support, failing businesses are going to spend the next several months laying off their workers, many of whom won’t be able to pay their bills with the unemployment benefits now on offer.
Even if Biden is able to pass his own recovery legislation in January, Democrats still have a political interest in making sure the transition to his presidency doesn’t become a frigid period of economic hardship.
Some, like New York magazine’s Josh Barro, have suggested that Biden could create an ersatz stimulus effect as president-elect by announcing his plans for a relief package, which could give employers and households a chance to plan accordingly.
Pelosi wanted to extend $600-a-week unemployment benefits until the end of January.
The Democrats’ number is probably closer to what’s needed long-term; one of the most in-depth recent forecasts of the fiscal pain states are confronting suggests that they could face $467 billion in revenue shortfalls from 2020 through 2022 (that number could be lower if unemployment falls quicker than anticipated, or higher if a second wave of COVID shuts the economy back down in the winter).
But half of what’s needed is certainly better than nothing, especially if a Biden administration is in a position to pass more aid down the line.
Going into these negotiations, Democrats needed to avoid passing a weak bill that would help Donald Trump politically more than it would actually help families, businesses, and states.
Trump Wants a Stimulus Deal Again.
It’s also unclear what would actually happen if Pelosi backtracked and tried to accept Mnuchin’s previous offer at this point.
Pelosi and the Democrats seem to have begun these talks assuming they could take a hard line in part because they believed there was no way the president would be irrational enough to endanger his reelection chances by walking away without a deal.","('pelosi', 0.1857187154712877)","('mnuchin’s', 0.16176778473140757)","('trillion', 0.14702198277737405)"
file-66,"When Congress let the $600 weekly unemployment payments it created in response to the coronavirus crisis expire at the end of July, many worried it would deal an immediate and painful blow to the economy.
Millions of jobless Americans were relying on the benefits to cover their bills, and cutting them off seemed like a good way to tank consumer spending (while deepening the country’s general atmosphere of misery).
The Commerce Department reported on Thursday that while personal incomes did fall by 2.7 percent in August, largely thanks to jobless benefits disappearing, consumer spending actually increased for the fourth month in a row, ticking up another 1 percent.
While job growth did slow down a bit between July and August, companies still continued bringing back their workers as states pushed forward with their reopening plans and customers returned.
At the same time, people who work in low-wage service industries like bars and restaurants are still facing mass joblessness, and it was reasonable to expect that slashing unemployment benefits would force many of them to cut back on spending.
According to Opportunity Insights, consumer spending in low-income ZIP codes increased through August.
The shares of Americans who said they couldn’t afford enough to eat and who were concerned about being able to make their next rent payment both declined from July to August, for instance.
If so many workers who were barely scraping by before are still out of work, why didn’t cutting their benefits cause more harm?
But it’s plausible that Americans on unemployment during the spring and early summer managed to save as well, given that thanks to the flat $600 federal payment, many beneficiaries were collecting more in benefits than they’d previously earned at work.
In short, Americans were able to keep spending as some people went back to work, some people finally got money they’d been owed for weeks if not months, and some people broke into their emergency savings.","('unemployment', 0.27531764000112746)","('americans', 0.24090293500098653)","('july,', 0.189869085971211)"
file-67,"Mortadella is an Italian cold cut made of pork and often studded with pistachios.
Its existence dates back to the Roman empire, and a cool 2,000 years later, mortadella is spreading like, well, whipped mortadella through the food scene in New York and beyond.
Mortadella’s the star of a delicate, open-faced amuse bouche at Tribeca’s Frenchette, and rears its pink-and-white head as a pizza topping at both Emmy Squared and Ops. You can get it on grilled focaccia at Coco Pazzo, or sliced thick and fried like a cutlet at Katana Kitten.
And over at Black Seed, they’re pairing it with mustard butter, a fried egg, and a pretzel bagel for a limited-edition sandwich.
In Boston, restaurateurs Charles Sillari and Sebastian Fricia have even opened up a restaurant called Mortadella Head with a menu that makes heavy use of—well, you already know.
“Mortadella” is a catchall term to describe a cold cut made from pork scraps and pieces of pork fat, which gets added to the mixture in cubes and gives mortadella its telltale white polka dots when sliced.
The main differences between bologna and mortadella are twofold: Making bologna involves a much simpler process, resulting in a less silky, nuanced texture than mortadella, plus it can be produced with other meats ground together with the pork, like beef.
Charles Sillari, who developed the menu for Mortadella Head in Boston, has experimented with mortadella meatballs.
Matt Hyland of Emmy Squared recommends rethinking how home cooks use mortadella between two slices of bread: “Get a chunk of it, cut it into pieces, and brown them—it’s a different way to make a sandwich.” It’s also excellent with pizza, either thinly shaved atop warm slices, or the way it’s used at Emmy Squared, cut into little batons that crisp up in the oven.
In pasta, mortadella can be used in place of another cured meat like bacon (in other words, cut into rods and crisped into oblivion) or as a a filling for stuffed noodle shapes.
Parker & Otis in Durham, N.C., use it on a grilled cheese with crispy bacon, but we think it’d be even better with a few slices of mortadella.
Classic Italian MuffulettaThe quintessential New Orleans sandwich, muffulettas are packed with cheese, lettuce, olives, and—of course—lots of cold cuts.
Rao’s MeatballsLike Sillari mentioned, mortadella is an A+ addition to your standard meatball recipe.
This one from iconic New York City restaurant Rao’s is one of our all-time favorites (and when you think about it, it’s really anything but standard).","('mortadella', 0.7157050774900702)","('pork', 0.13763559182501348)","('pizza', 0.11393537138519785)"
